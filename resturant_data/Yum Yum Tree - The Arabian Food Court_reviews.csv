Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,The Food O‚ÄôClock,"It is at 6th floor of Act Boutique building that the entrance gate is just opposite to Karachi Bakery. The building is little bit inside. Once you get there, u will find a cafe on the ground floor.
The place is cool, not so noisy, spacious and hygiene. Service is fast. They have seating arrangement in two ways, 1) chair and table 2) carpet seating like traditional.

We ordered mutton Haleem and Chicken Fahm Mandi Half for two people. There was no chicken haleem.

The mutton Haleem was delicious. I feel this is the best Haleem I had. Taste- 5/5

The chicken Fahm Mandi was delicious too. The masala was perfect. But people who don‚Äôt like masala may not be pleased much. They give good amount of chicken. Taste-5/5",5,"26 Reviews , 13 Followers",5/23/2019 22:40,8,
Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Tanzeem Alam,I am new to Hyderabad.. heard of the Hyderabadi Haleem here is very famous so ordered haleem from this restaurant. It was a disastrous experience. Please dont try any kind of haleem here. I haven't tried any other dish here and now I am hesitant to order any other dish from here after having haleem here.,1,1 Review,5/19/2019 23:23,0,
Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Saif Rahman Khan,"Situated at the heart of the town, this is by far the best place to lay your hands on Arabian and Yemeni dishes in the City of Nawabs. With stiff competition from more than a dozen other restaurants in the area, the prices are average but the Quality is exceptional. The ambience of the place is exceptional and with adequate lights which are extremely soothing to the eyes. Food apart, the whole setup of the restaurant creates a Unique Aura for all food lovers.

Note :- Plz do try the BBQ Chicken Mandi and the Juicy Chicken Mandi. They are the best items from the whole menu.

Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Nikhil Naik,"I had been here with my office colleagues for lunch. We order malai chicken and mix chicken mandi. I earlier had mandi at different places in Hyderabad but this place was awesome. They had nice interiors with seating arrangements. If you are not comfortable seating on the rug then you can sit on table and chair. For food I would rate it 5+ for amazing taste, quantity and for that Arabian food feel. We order 2 mandi and we all 8 of us were so full and started feeling sleepy. As it was lunch time we had to build some courage and go to office:-)...will be visiting again to try some Mutton mandi.",5,"5 Reviews , 23 Followers",5/5/2019 13:04,1,

Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Biswarup Bose,Have always been a fan of the Shawarma of this place. Therefore wanted to try the mandi as well. But was utterly disappointed with the quality of rice being served. By no means it seemed to be mandi rice. It was more like Pulao rice. Considering the price that I paid the quality was no match for it. Mandi rice is never sticky but in this case it was. Kindly look into the image and you will understand.,1,"22 Reviews , 63 Followers",4/28/2019 17:06,1,

Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Nawaz Mohammed,"We were 2 friends wanted to eat some mandi.. I know some is not the right word when it comes to mandi.. With that huge plate and all.. So yum yum tree is a great place to eat mandi. It was around 2o clock in noon when we visited..the place is very calm and not on main road but its easy to find.
Ambience is spot on arabic, songs played are romantic. The guy who served us had a smile on his face all the time he's serving us. Nothing to complain about the place at the same time nothing to praise too.
We ordered bbq chiken mandi and grill fish..
Grill fish was oki dint like it much but my friend loved it.. She likes fish may be thats why!
BBQ chiken mandi was amazing i can place them in top 5 mandis in hyderabad..!

Maybe the day was different for me but I was really very dissapointed with the service they had given. We asked for raita and we were served after we almost finished our mandi. I hate such late servings.
Mandi was all overhyped with taste being not that great. Instead I find it better at other places.

Ambience wise it is nicer than other mandi restaurants. However the choice of music could have been better.

Overall I would say its just a waste to ur pocket and palate.",3,"17 Reviews , 8 Followers",3/10/2019 3:08,1,

Food: We had the mixed mandi platter which is like 1k+ but really huge with good variety of chicken grill, tandoori, mutton, french fries, etc.
The rice is also fine and is accompanied by good amount of fried onion and cashew nuts and other sides like mayo and tomato chutney.

Food-
Yum yum tree is famous for it's Arabic Mandi, they also serve various kinds of starters and shawarmas. We placed an order for Chicken Stick Mandi and Chicken Barbeque Mandi. Chicken stick Mandi has 6-7 boneless chicken pieces, which were tasted perfectly with Mandi rice. Half Chicken barbeque Mandi included 2 large barbeque chicken pieces served with 2 types of gravies.

Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Pavan Rishit Meka,"As the name says: If you want to checkout the yummy Arabian food in Hyderabad, then this your place.

The ambience is very spacious and resembles the Arabic style of interior decor and seating. This also has camel prototype placed in the entrance.

If you're a hater of sea food, you will start loving it after eating the Grill Fish Tikka from here.

Food we tried here:

Chicken BBQ Tikka
Grill Fish Tikka
Chicken Arabian Mix Mandi

All the 3 items that we tried here are the best of it's kind. Chicken BBQ Tikka is the best of the grilled chicken that I have tried before. Grill Fish Tikka comes with a single complete grilled fish without any bones. It just melts in your mouth and if you try it with white mayonnaise it tastes the best.

Chicken Arabian Mix Mandi comes with Arabian Mix Grill Platter. It's comes with a combination of Chicken Tikka, chicken wings, Grill Fish Tikka, Chicken BBQ Tikka and Mutton.

This was the best Mandi I ever had. It has rice cooked in Arabian style with Kaju, kishmish and fried onions sprinkled all over the rice. This combination of rice with grilled non-veg Tikka gives you a foodgasm. And also it easily serves for 4 to 5 people if you're on a very high appetite.

Service here is really good and cost is reasonable for all the items. So if you're planning to try Arabian food in this city of Nizam, then do try this place.",4,"64 Reviews , 540 Followers",12/3/2018 0:09,14,

It was one of the best fish dishes I‚Äôve tasted in town, I‚Äôm particular about my fish, not much bones or fins, should not
Smell bad and should be cooked well, all 3 criteria was a tick with a wonderful flavour and the accompanying mayo sauce was just perfect. High standards set with first dish, expectations were only growing as we waited for Lebanese chicken , it was just juicy , cooked well and was fresh and tasted great. So a 5 on 5 for starters. Now moving to the the attraction of the day, the Mandi it was authentic Middle East preparation, with tangy spicy gravy accompaniments, ordered juicy mutton Mandi, mutton quality was above par, Mandi was great , if you are a spice lover, Mandi is not for you.

We have to sit on sofas with legs crossed and food is served on short movable table placed on sofa.

People go here to have mandi, the dish that they are meant for. We too have ordered chicken stick mandi along with two other chicken starters, chicken tikka and chicken wings, of which the former was palatable.
We had mandi for the first time and were flabbergasted by the enormous size of plate and quantity of food. Five of us were unable to finish it off, rice was soft and chicken pieces were tender and rightly marinated.
The feeling of multiple people having food from same plate is amusing.
Their service deserves a special mention, they just appear when we need them and give us privacy otherwise.

Yum Yum Tree - The Arabian Food Court,Gaurav Lall,"Honestly, I've been to this place couple of times in frequent events. 1st two times I really loved the Mandi, but last two times it was just ok ok. Have you guys sacrificed your quality or it was the odd timing both the time I went?? I feel the taste should be same all the time. Specially the rice in the mandi use to be tastier than chicken or mutton but now its just ok ok type. Dont do this guys, you have one of the best for Mandis in Hyderabad please maintain your quality.",2,1 Review,7/30/2018 7:19,0,

Loved the mutton mandi which is served with marag soup and other two gravies, mutton was soft, tender and juicy and bbq chicken was perfectly marinated and grilled.Staff needs an improvement on their service.Manager was kind enough to give us corporate discount when asked.Overall good taste of food and good place with nice relaxed ambience of arabian restaurant within that area.",4,"14 Reviews , 77 Followers",7/7/2018 11:33,3,
