Pot Pourri,Binnani,"I had bad experience here with Masala Papad. I had went for dinner with colleagues and had order 13 masala papad. Spice level was too high and it was not editable. 15 people were not even able to finish 2 out of thirteen . So don't order Masala Papad

Pot Pourri,Chandrasekhar Dasika,"*IF YOU ARE READING THIS, AND SITLL GOING TO THIS PLACE - EITHER YOU WORK THERE OR YOU ARE DU#B*
*I STRONGLY DISCOURAGE FAMILIES WITH KIDS FROM VISITING THIS PLACE*

*WRITING THIS REVIEW WITHIN 10 HOURS OF VISITING THIS PLACE*

Wish I could give a negative rating. This place is ridiculously lazy. No this review is not about food, cost or ambience. This is about people and their mindset.

810pm: four of us including two kids aged kids aged 2 and 7 step in

815pm: another large party and a couple of other families check-in

820pm: menu card was give to us

830pm: someone walked over to take the order but not before taking orders for other two parties (thug life!). We order Veg Biriyani, two rotis and Kadai Paneer

845pm: remind them about the order; said we need a couple of minutes

845pm: other groups already served food

850pm: remind them about the order; informed it will take another couple of minutes. My two year old son already started crying for food; elder daughter clearly getting irritated

855pm: again informed it will take a couple of minutes. i said I will walk out if food doesnt come in 30s.

856pm: our family walks out in front of the staff. Staff doesnt make the slightest attempt to stop us

The last part obviously indicates they havent started the preparation yet. So no loss in letting us leave.

The sheer apathy of staff was quite overwhelming. I can understand being profit centric and your obvious need to serve a bigger party. But with two hungry kids kept waiting for more than 45 min at your place without any food being offered smacks of apathy and insensitivity (after being reminded about it). And in this time and age of digital pervasiveness, beign careless about it is inviting trouble.",1,"5 Reviews , 29 Followers",5/13/2019 12:48,0,
Pot Pourri,Saikrishna Javvaji,"went for A-LA-Carte here.. Heard a lot about this previously. went with full of excitement. I wanna rate this restaurant in 3 aspects. 1. Ambience: I should say it is just OK. they could have done it much better. Looks like they have spent a lot on establishment but no aww factor. 2.Taste: The food tastes good here. Almost every main course and starter were good except the dessert - Carrot Halwa and Mango Juice(Welcome Drink). They both didn't taste good. 3.Hospitality: The Hospitality is quite good. I was satisfied with the staff in the restaurant.

As a whole, I would recommend going here. You will love the food.",4,"1 Review , 75 Followers",5/11/2019 16:00,0,

Some south indian festival was going on in the restaurant, so the expectations were little high but a complete let down. Firstly, they had not planned properly to manage 40 plus people. Some people who arrived first got the privilege of getting welcome drink and I arrived 10 mins late, and simply didn't get it. For starters also, some privileged ones got served with only few of the varieties as per the menu. Our of frustration, people started with main course and in between starters were being served.

Pot Pourri,Prasant Kumar,"All Star to the Food, Service and ambience... We were looking for a good banquet or Restaurant in Gachibowli area to celebrate our 10th Marriage anniversary. As the moment was special we were looking for a place where we can enjoy the time with family and friends. Searched almost 5-6 locations but bottomed down to Pot Pourri. Were little concerened if made the right choice...but VOILA.. on the event day we were very very happy to see the below specific observations:
1.Quality of Food - We have given few instructions on the buffet spread and also asked for North Indian taste in food. The instructions that we have given was executed line by line...not an inch of difference... Food was great...I got lot of enquires from guests that how did I locate this place... Very Very satisfied... Must taste from my side- Bengal fish curry and Nizami Handi..

The starters typically was in taking terms among the guests... Awsome..

2. Service- The staff was courtious and they took care of each guests personally.. It was no less than a private party, though we havn't booked the restaurant fully...but seeing the service we  were very happy... 

3. Ambience- The restaurant is cleanly decorated..not so much noise in decor... As we want a special moment and we were in doubt how to setup the environment with some personal touch, the staff themselves took the lead and asked for few items in the morning...and when we entered in the evenning we were quite surprised to see the decoration just the right.. this is called the owning of stuff... 

Kudos to the staff and management for taking our request and customizing every bit of the arrangements as per the need of the event... VERY HAPPY...HIGHLY RECOMMENDED...ALL STARS...",5,"1 Review , 1 Follower",4/29/2019 8:51,0,

Pot Pourri,Mr. Ego,"A good place with a calm ambience and a lot of pots.
We went in for the √Ä la carte. The service was a bit slow, they need to speed up on that. We ordered crispy baby corn. Usually not a fan of corn, but loved this one. Also, the masala papad was a good one. We went ahead with the main course. The kadai paneer and rumali roti were good. Would give it a 3.5/5.
Overall, a place with a different theme and calm ambience. This place is worth a visit and is also economical.

The place opens up to you with nicely set up wall decorations which says true to the restaurants name ( with a lot of pots üòâ) and amazing ambience.

We happened to drop by on a weekday towards the closing time.

Pot Pourri,Parijat Ray,"We visited this restaurant recently. We have ordered Potpourri Royyala Vepudu, Gongura Mamsam ( not there in the menu, they have made it on our request ) and plain rice.

Potpourri Royyala Vepudu: A south Indian style prawn ( medium sized ) starter (dry). This dish had at least 15-20 prawns. The prawns were coated and cooked in spices. The prawns were little chewy in texture but was very tasty.

Gongura Mamsam: Small pieces of mutton cooked in a gongura based gravy. We found this dish too sour ( I guess they have added tamarind too ) compared to our previous experience with Gongura based gravy.

Overall experience was nice. The service was good.",3,"146 Reviews , 333 Followers",4/8/2019 19:20,2,

Pot Pourri,Akarsh Prabhu,"Had been here to taste authentic andhra/telangana Cuisine. 
Tried the Cashew chicken starter and the Prawn biriyani. 

The starter was nothing but boneless chicken fried in some bland batter with fried cashew stuck to it. It looked like some home made beginner dish. It was really dry. The server even forgot to give me chutney with it. 

The only thing andhra about the biriyani was the spice level. It was above normal levels. Otherwise no special flavour. The dish didnt have enough salt , which we added later, OURSELF. 
There was some birthday party going on, because of which each dish took an hour to get to us. 

After all this hassle, they give  us complimentary gulab jamun from the buffet which was nowhere a compensation for the bad experience or for the price we paid. 

I am just hoping this isnt the real telangana cuisine which it is famous for and I was just at the wrong place.",2,"5 Reviews , 69 Followers",4/3/2019 17:03,0,
Pot Pourri,Afreen Jahan,"*Writing this review as soon as I got out of the restaurant*
From the beginning itself the restaurant caught my bad impression and bad experience. Left right after starters. I wouldn't even care to rate it one star. One of worst restaurants to dine-in. I think it'll be good experience for corporate lunches or dinners because the more the people the more theüí∞üí∞üí∞
After reaching at 2 PM there was no receptionist. After the receptionist finally came they made us wait for more than 20 minutes to find and set up the table for just 2 people. It was very clear that the tables just needed plates to be arranged. That's it. A piece of advise to y'all: if you see any restaurant taking this long without any valid reason then please get outta there. Neither proper AC chambers nor proper cooling. It was HOT. Thanks POT POURRI for understanding and making our dining uncomfortableüòí. After we sat they took extremely long time and then cared to ask if we're opting for veg or non-veg. By this time I was already wondering if they thought we're idiots and they can just make us wait and treat however they want, I just realised that it was true.
After soup and buttermilk starters were served PAINFULLY SLOW. It took MORE THAN AN HOUR FOR THEM TO FINISH SERVING JUST 6 STARTERS. Were they kidding me?? They wasted my precious time and this isn't what a customer wants. If you can't give importance to our time then we better eat elsewhere. We had to school the waiters regarding their service, then we spoke to their leader(I guess) and he also gave the same old typical answer ""sorry. I'll just get that served for you"". We don't want no sorry. You can't placate us with sorry for our time, hard work and money spent. After seeing no improvement we finally had to speak to the manager as listen to ""sorrys"". I decided to leave the restaurant. After all this HE HAD THE AUDACITY TO CHARGE US THE COMPLETE BILL. It was 1100. It wasn't even worth it even if we had the whole menu. After arguing he decided to give 10% discount which in his case made a hole in his pocket as as if it would make it up for the experience we hadüòí. Wouldn't suggest nor would even like to think about this restaurant.
Starters: I found the starters to be normal good in quality. Not very impressive nor was menu standing out. If you pay 100-200 more you'll be getting much better restaurant in many aspects especially in terms of food.
1. Soup: we were served chicken soup. It wasn't impressive. It was fine.
2. Buttermilk under drinks: it was tasty.
3. Chicken tikka: it was ok. It was hard, sometimes soft.
4. Ajwani paneer tikka: it was very good in taste.
5. Kodi vepudu: it was chicken with common known marination. I mean it felt like typical Indian curry. It was just good.
6. Fried veg green chilli: it was just ok in taste. Couldn't make out if it's actually chilly.
7. Corn fried fish: it was fish coated with corn flakes which was giving nice honey taste. Probably this is the only best thing there.
8. Crispy corn: corn was crispy as expected and tasted good.
Main course: I found it to be typically common. Nothing new if you've been to buffets before.
Accompaniments were regular papad, curd, naan, roti.
Desserts: not much varieties. What's there is menu is served.
Ambience: I don't care about ambience as long as food is good and my patience isn't tested.",1,"60 Reviews , 16 Followers",3/29/2019 16:49,15,

Pot Pourri,Manpreet,i visited this place last friday with my friends and we had ala carte. I don‚Äôt want to give any rating the service was very poor and slow there main focus was people having buffet. After waiting for 25 mins and lot of reminders we got our food. When the bill came they have added additional items which we didn‚Äôt had cost around 600 to the bill and my friends bad she didn‚Äôt checked the bill that time. So after this horrible experience i will suggest not to visit and id you are visting and having ala carte please cross check the bill before paying otherwise you can be the next victims of this thugs restaurant.,1,"1 Review , 5 Followers",2/11/2019 18:36,0,

Pot Pourri,Yogesh Jain,"The worst experience that I had along with friends. The starters are good but the main course is completely tasteless. Even after informing the management about the taste, they were asking if salt or spice is more, but not about the overall quality & taste about the food. Very much disappointed that I took my friends for a treat here.",1,1 Review,2/7/2019 23:36,0,
Pot Pourri,Anjanaa Karthik,"Well, this restaurant looked really appealing and we wanted to try it very badly! So we ordered a lot. Veg and non veg dishes. The best was were the chinese starters. Honey chilli potato was amazing. The shangai veg was also good. Non veg starters were not that great though. And we ordered naan and kadai paneer. There was absolutely no salt and the paneer was really hard. Biriyani was really good and the schezuan rice not good either. I think they added coconut oil to it. I'm really not a big fan of coconut oil. Can visit once.
