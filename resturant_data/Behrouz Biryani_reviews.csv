Behrouz Biryani,Fatima,"First the price is too high and the quantity I'm getting is lower than the expectation . You can see the cup it's so small like its just gave me for only to taste it. And about the taste it's good. I like it. And I also got a small bread with this,like who eats bread with a 'Daleem'.
I would not recommend you to eat but If you just want to have a bite of taste then go ahead. :)",2,"4 Reviews , 4 Followers",5/25/2019 1:14,4,
Behrouz Biryani,Mithun Abe Mohan,"I ordered the biryani with great expectations. The packaging, and the presentation is extremely nice, and the aroma was great. The biryani thigh, was frozen in the middle! It's a prepackaged frozen food reheated at the time of ordering. That is not the expectation, at least in Hyderabad!
The fact that it is not fresh offsets a lot of the positives for me",2,"11 Reviews , 117 Followers",5/18/2019 18:01,0,

Behrouz Biryani,S G K,The Behrouz Biryani is the Royal Biryani. The flavour of Rice is super and the pieces of chicken are yummy. The presentation of Biryani is with fried onions and Badam ( Almond ) . Served with Mint Raitha and Gulab Jamun.,5,"10 Reviews , 11 Followers",4/19/2019 21:35,1,

Behrouz Biryani,Shyamu,"One of the worst biriyanis i ate . Home deliverd thru zomato . Very worse . I wud like to cook my self though tired than ordering in behrouse.one of the worst biryani i ever had. One has to pay for packaging only. Big packaging and less quantity. One should never order from Behroz biryani. Do not go with their briyani picturs shown on website in reality its only rice packed in some big attractive boxesNever try biryani here , However we were shocked to find just one piece of mutton in the Biryani. Not sure how Behrouz expected us to consume the box full of rice with a small piece of mutton. We have decided not to order anymore from this restaurant. worst of a kind and never tasted such filthy biryani in my life , and secondly they are charging bomb price for such filthy biryani ie 379 
No taste and no quality. I wonder where he brought his chef from to prepare biryani , guess from a local slum area to get this biryani made and serving to innocent public of Hyderabad

Note 
increase the quality food then no matter what the price is .",1,1 Review,3/24/2019 0:02,0,
Behrouz Biryani,Govind,"So much hype for a sub par biryani. Ordered paneer biryani, taste did not live upto the hype. The taste was bland, could have been better. Any local biryani place has much better biryani at a lower price.",3,1 Review,3/20/2019 14:06,0,
Behrouz Biryani,Parimal Khatri,"I've order for home delivery. The service was quick and Hassle Free.

Ordered veg biryani from the restaurant as suddenly I was craving for veg. I was so impressed by the packing & also they give raita & gulab jamun with it.

The biryani was properly packed. And was warm enough to eat too. It had a really good taste that other places with veg biryani don't. It's really different. And its very tasty.
One can definitely try their veg biryani.

Behrouz Biryani,Karna Nair,Ordered the much hyped about Behrouz biriyani today.Wanted to have it since ages.So today when the package came I was really thrilled.The biriyani comes in a stunning package.And as you open it the room fills with amazing Biriyani smells.The biriyani was looks good with a lot of almonds and greens as garnishing on top.The biriyani comes with raita and a gulab jamun too.The biriyani is quite different from the other popular biriyani in Hyderabad.This one is extremely sutle in taste.The chicken was tender and was breaking apart easily. The rice grains were staying apart and was expertly cooked.Overall the biriyani was a really good experience.But I personally prefer the spicy type when it comes to Biriyani but this biriyani is different and it is mouth wateringly delicious in a completely different way.,3,"30 Reviews , 63 Followers",2/15/2019 22:46,2,

Behrouz Biryani,Khaane_mey_kya_hey By Rony Samuel,"Well this is an absolute honest review from a hardcore Hyderabadi and a true foodie.. I understand a lot of people complain about behrouz biryani but here's my review, behrouz is not a Hyderabadi biryani and is unique in itself and the brand claims it's biryani not being local.

I might not like it to the core as an Hyderabadi but as a food critique I don't have any complaints.. it's unique in it's preparation, was absolutely mild, ordered chicken lazeez biryani which had juicy chicken pieces, the quantity was sufficient for two moderate eaters, was aromatic and we'll garnished with dry fruits.

Felt the flavour was somewhere between a regular biryani and Mandi, now this review even holds strong backing as I had a Irani friend who liked it as well.

Really loved the packaging and the complimentary desert. The gulab jamun definitely killed the joy at the end, did regret eating it..and the mint raitha can definitely do be improved.

Nothing changed but got an add on ‚Äúthe black box‚Äù which has a chocolate lava cake which was the only thing good. The package was good like before and as expected. Nothing to say about that biryani because I didn‚Äôt taste it. On an assumetion the biryani was with good mutton peices and didnt look that spicy and had almond pieces over.

Firstly, packaging was good, seemed like a gift box with cutlery and mouth freshener. Then, coming to biryani, Aroma was pleasant and circulated over the entire room within no time. Chicken pieces were well cooked and melted in the mouth. Biryani tasted sweet, even with lots of masala, unlike the other conventional Hyderabadi spicy ones. Two add-On options available, Mirchi salan and mint raitha to order as required. Quantity and quality of rice is good.

Behrouz Biryani,Ankita Shilpa,"I had ordered Lazeez Bhuna Murgh Biriyani from Behrouz Biriyani. The packaging really impressed me, because in case of Biriyani when it is present in a bowl, it is tough to eat it directly from that, but Behrouz serves it in a plate kinda aluminum box, with the necessary cutleries attached, and the flat feature enables the consumer to have each spoon flavourful with no spices left out. Then about the taste of the Biriyani, well it wasn't exactly up to my expectations, as my personal choice of Biriyani is the one with the ittar aroma and spices as well, but this one had spices which tasted sweet. So it was basically a SWEET Biriyani. The chicken pieces were small and many, like big chunks, but were good. Mint raita was also impressive. If you have a sweet tooth in main courses too, then you can go for this Biriyani.

Behrouz Biryani,Naveen Yavvari,"I have ordered a biriyani and the restaurant took close to one hour just to prepare the food. And the zomato delivery person took 30 more mins to deliver the food. One of the worst service from zomato. 

When it comes to the food, it was pretty average. I dint feel like i am having a biriyani.",2,1 Review,9/21/2018 22:58,0,

Behrouz Biryani,Sanjeet Kumar Bhukta,"I heard about behrouz biriyani many times from my friends . So finally ordred dum ghost biriyani as I am a mutton lover.

The best thing what I attracted is the packeging and looks. it was came with a box consist of a gluab jamun and flavoured biriyani rice with 4 mid size boneless mutton pieces, fried onions and small almond pieces.

The taste was some thing different. It was not like the others biriyanis what common and normal n taste and easily available everywhere in hyderabad .

I would love to order or visit the place again . Highly recommended for biryani lovers who are looking for some new taste.",5,"25 Reviews , 979 Followers",9/8/2018 13:40,0,

Behrouz Biryani,Deepa Arora,A rich flavoured Bhuna Murg biryani from this place surely will delight ur taste buds. As I opened the box of my Biryani the aroma was so tempting. It tasted yum topped with lots of deep fried onions and almonds. It has more of the Lucknowi Biryani taste. The only reason I don‚Äôt give it a 5 is it is way too rich as a meal.,4,"39 Reviews , 150 Followers",8/30/2018 2:59,0,
Behrouz Biryani,Praveen Sai,"@delivery, poor customer support. Both me and zomato were unable to contact restaurant. Restaurant didn't update status in app as well. After 3 hours a guy called me that he is out to deliver the food. Which is hours after I requested zomato customer care and cancelled my order. And it happened second time. Earlier they answered but said it will take one and half hour I waited and not delivered. This is my second bad experience... Very sad about it.",1,"1 Review , 1 Follower",8/27/2018 11:56,0,
