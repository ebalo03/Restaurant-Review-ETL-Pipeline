The Indi Grill,Satyadivyak,"Went with our friends for a casual lunch on Friday
As usual it was Soo rush and waiters and staff over there are in hurry to serve us fast and want to throw us out of the restaurant.üòê
Yeahh it‚Äôs fine we can understand but there should be a polite way to convey the same,it should not be like ur time is done..leave now..leave now...
That is a negative of the management over there.
Coming to the food
For veg..the starters are only 3....potato..crispy corn and mushroom and on the grill pineapple and paneer. Not a worthy starters for veg
For non veg...starters were good..there are all varieties of non vegetarian on grill and served in plates
Main course...Not at all worthy...and not tasty..ü§¢
Only one rice item..tasteless and curries and other items were not tasty
Salads were good
Chat items not worthy
Deserts are good..3 desi sweets and as usual pastries cakes and pudding
And lastly the people working over there forces us to give 5 rating on zomato even before we complete our lunch and leave out.
They want us to give the rating infront of them

The Indi Grill,Dyagamrahul,"Went for a lunch Buffet yesterday and we were around 17 ppl.

The best part is they mention the name and place allocated on the entrance.

Ambiance is good and they welcomed with a mocktail.

Coming to starters, non veg was awesome and veg starters looked quite ok. But they can introduce something new as its same everywhere.

We have chicken wings, chicken kabab, fish, prawns. They were just amazing.

We have Tawa chicken and Prawns but that was not up to the mark and that Tawa items needs a huge change in taste.

Main course was above average and they had some amazing dishes like Laal Maas(mutton), prawns were awesome(love to visit again to eat this amazing prawns)

Coming to Desserts, they were just melting in mouth, my all time favourite Jilebi with Rabdi, asked for some hot Jilebi at the end as well, I got a few.
Kheer was ok, gulab jamun was good.

Overall experience is good. It needs some minor changes in few dishes.

The only complain about this place is the playlist,(more of old and sad bollywood songs) it was so loud and it totally is a huge off.I suggest please change the playlist guys,it's ruining the whole vibe of the place,this is the first time i had to bear music instead of enjoying it.Anyways,i liked the unexpected visit to this place.",4,"85 Reviews , 673 Followers",4/30/2019 15:36,0,

Taste was good for most of the items. Staffs were polite and quick on services. Only thing which didnt went well was AC of the resturant. As it was a hot afternoon, AC was not enough to cool us downüòï. Manger apologized for this. They also gave us a 10% off on total bill because of 20+ people.

Advices to management = Please have some unique food item which is not there on other places.

Its better you mention them the spice level before itself. Even main course was pretty good in terms of taste. Nothing much special in the menu but taste and staff were good.

One of the rare places where you'll find consistent quality across dishes - starters, main course, and dessert. Jalebi does require a special mention.

Combine this with courteous staff who ensure you have a good time right from the moment you step in and you have the perfect experience.

I would recommend visiting the place in the first slot, as things are reasonably quiet. Not surprised at all that the second slot starts getting crowded!

If I had to be really critical, the veg menu has that tiny scope of improvement in an otherwise perfect place. Keep it going!",5,"4 Reviews , 3 Followers",4/26/2019 21:50,0,

The Indi Grill,Kriti Jain,"Overall food was good. Anytime better than BBQ Nation. Salad options could have been improved. Menu was loaded with regional foods like Gatte ki Sabji of Rajasthan, Bengali Fish Curt. Etc. However, Gatte ki Sabji not at all upto the mark",4,1 Review,4/21/2019 15:06,0,

The Indi Grill,Akshay Kirti,"One of the latest buffet places in town. Visited there last weekend for lunch. Quite a big place with good decor. Staff were helpful and service was quick. I loved the starters there. Chicken leg kebab, other chicken starter were also very good. The best was prawns, tandoori prawns were just amazing. Crispy corn, salsa potato and pineapple were also available. Main course also had good variety from chicken, mutton to fish. Desserts were also good. Loved the galebi and rabdi the most",4,"149 Reviews , 524 Followers",4/20/2019 18:10,3,
The Indi Grill,Manoj Katragadda,"Food= Taste and variety of food items=3/5
Ambience = Look and Feel=3/5
Service= Timely service and Cleanliness=2.5/5
Pocket= Quantity vs Price =5/5
Value= Quality=4/5

When it comes to spread of items, they were just too many. Barbeque items, main course as well as desserts. The taste was however was not to the level of satisfaction. Ambience was just average.

Service definitely needs a heavy improvement. We went on a non rush day, serving of barbeque items were over flowing in the first and single service. There is no concept of coming to the table second time. No one really really bothered the table. Even after requesting so many times, servers really didn't bother much to serve breads in the table or refilling any barbeque items. We just had to go with the main course to continue our lunch. Mutton Curry and biryani were extra ordinary. Jalebi served in desserts was too good",3,"30 Reviews , 48 Followers",4/19/2019 22:55,0,

The Indi Grill,Santosh Pappachan,"This is located prominently along the main road and is a part of the same group which has the Moti Mahal chain of restaurants.

Hopped in for lunch on a weekday after a movie at the nearby mall and it was a good experience to put it across in a lucid manner. The starters have mostly the usual fare you'd see in a typical barbeque restaurant. There was chicken, fish, prawn, mutton seekh kebab, chicken tangdi, chicken meat balls etc. in the non veg fare. The veg had the typical paneer, pineapple, corn on the cob, crispy potatoes in sauce which I would say were delectable along with the crispy corns. There is a complimentary mocktail which was decent but the masala coke I ordered later had too much masala and too little fizz for my liking.

The chats were toothsome and lip smackingly tasty. I also liked the kulchhas and parathas in the main course. They were soft and had the right texture and taste. Just the way they should be. Special mention of the veg and non veg manchow soup which was appetizing. My wife had multiple rounds of the same. The chicken, fish and mutton curries were good but I liked the dal makhni and matar methi malai among the lot. The gulab jamun and halwa along with the jalebi and rabdi were supremely delicious in the desserts section.

The service was quick and prompt. Special mention of Raghuveer Singh who took care of our requirements and was always available when required. This is not a big place hence the ambiance is not much to talk about. They have seating on the first floor too which is an added bonus. All in all, this is definitely a place worth trying!",4,"107 Reviews , 634 Followers",4/11/2019 11:41,2,
The Indi Grill,The Hungry Indians,"Located in the busy streets of kondapur this one gains quite an attention
Indigrill is a chain of the grand Moti Mahal restaurants
Set up in ground and first floors has a decent ambience
For present they are only running buffet section but they are going to start A-la-carte soon
.
.
We have been invited to try their buffet section
Welcomed by the friendly staff we have been served first with their welcome drink
Then moving on to the grill they had chicken fish and prawns on BBQ in non veg
Fish and prawns tasted great while chicken was a little hard
In vegetarian paneer mushroom and pineapple were served
Apart from grill they had other starters too
Mutton sheek kabab served here is one of the best I ever had
Fresh minced mutton made into soft kebabs tasted amazing
And crabs were little but slow cooked and prepared in such a way that the flesh comes off easily tasted amazing
.
.
We were almost filled with starters but their main course spread is huge too
My favorites were
Crab curry and mutter paneer
.
.
And in desserts
Gulad jamun and jilebi with rabdi were lip smacking
Strawberry pudding and phirni tasted good too",4,"109 Reviews , 621 Followers",4/10/2019 17:49,27,
