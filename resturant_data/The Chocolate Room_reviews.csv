The Chocolate Room,Prachita Jayaswal,The chocolate excess cake was awesome. It was a completely filled with chocolate ganache. It is fairly priced. It isn't bitter in taste. The cake was moist and juicy. The ambience of this place is good. Nice place to hangout with friends.,5,"104 Reviews , 531 Followers",5/23/2019 1:16,2,

The Chocolate Room,Foodoholic,"In general my experience with the chocolate room was not up to the mark.
I had oreo cookie shake and KitKat shake at two separate visits. Both tasted bland and I couldnt quite get the crispyness of oreo and flavour of the KitKat.
I hope they improve ..",2,"7 Reviews , 6 Followers",5/21/2019 14:47,0,
The Chocolate Room,Rajat,"Went there for morning breakfast but what a disappointment, everything out of stock no nachos,no stock for their signature chocolate pizzas. I seriously wonder was it a way denying customer for using zomato gold privileges or what. Cz first i placed the order the waiter said it will take 15 mins but when i showed him gold unlock he simply said its out of stock. What a shame!!",1,"3 Reviews , 2 Followers",5/19/2019 10:29,0,

The Chocolate Room,Raghu Dahagam,"Chocolate room!!
A must visit place for all the chocolate lovers!!
This chain has been around for more than a decade now and they still keep me amused each time I visit.

I tried dark chocolate fondue. The dark chocolate was flavourful, thick and glossy. The dips were very well coherent with the chocolate and they are all 100% eggless!

Potato wedges poutine was another dish that I loved the most and you should not miss this! It has white sauce pasta base with well seasoned potato wedges!

The pancakes were fulffy and are perfect when paired with hot chocolate!

Service - was bit slow as we went around 10 pm but the staff is really attentive !

Price- Reasonable price for the quality and the quantity they serve!",5,"75 Reviews , 202 Followers",5/3/2019 0:28,5,

The Chocolate Room,Manu S Kurup,"I'm disappointed after last night's dinner I had here. I was visiting TCR after a long time and ordered a Dark on warm mug, Salad and a Mint Mojito. While the Dark was awesome, the other two items disappointed me. The Salad had very raw cucumber and it gave me a bad stomach pain from which I'm still suffering. They also gave a plastic fork to eat a salad which has chicken, cucumber, lettuce, capsicum and tomato. Giving plastic fork to substitute real cutlery is way more disappointing than anything in a place as reputed as TCR. The mint Mojito was a tad bit less disappointing. The syrups flavor dominated all the way till half the glass!",2,"20 Reviews , 73 Followers",1/30/2019 9:14,2,

The Chocolate Room,Srinivas K,"Tried Pizza and Spaghetti looking at the reviews. Not sure how this place has 3+ Rating.

Food taste- not that great and specially at the price you would expect some quality or effort in it.

Pizza had an uncooked base and the sauce they used on the base was normal sweet ketchup. A few bellpeppers on top and rest was normal cheese. Not what you will expect after giving 250 bucks for it. Same with Spaghetti- came in a tiny box, no garlic bread, On the name of Aglio olio- it was just couple of olives and olive oil and nothing else.

Hence, the price is not too costly if you keep the quantity in mind. It was a brownie and ice cream kinda mixture which was too chocolaty and perfect for the chocolate craving. The waffer became soggy in it and didn't taste good.

The Chocolate Room,Shahil Varshney,"Bounty milk shake: -1/5We ordered a Bounty milk shake and that was the pathetic so called ""SHAKE"" I ever had in my Life so Far. And the price was Rs 189 which was not even worth if given for free. A normal tea from office pantry tastes far better than this drink. I dont have an option for giving a NEGATIVE Rating, hence forced to give a ""1"", when its not even worth to have a rating. We were so hungry and planned to have some food, but we were so tired with the shake given and we packed up without even finishing half glass of the drink.

The Chocolate Room,Vedant Killa,"Sinful. Nothing describes this place better. üò¨

Going through their super extensive menu would probably make you tired, but the service is so appalling, probably you‚Äôll die of hunger waiting for your order to arrive. The place is cosy enough for you to carry a laptop and spend a couple hours on an assignment. I‚Äôd recommend you do that cause anyway, they deliver orders after forever. üôà

As the name goes, I‚Äôve always had it in my mind to relate this place to a dessert bar. And hence, I‚Äôve never tried the savoury items offered here. But I‚Äôve heard they have a good offering among sandwiches and nachos. So that would keep my review limited only to the sweet dishes. üôÇ

The Toblerone Shake and the Kitkat Shake are the shizzz. So full of the taste- actually well prepared. The chocolate brownie is really a waste of money: you‚Äôve probably had much better brownies all over Hyderabad. üòù

Nutella Waffles and Death by Chocolate pancakes: so good ! A heaven full of chocolate sauce and ice cream. Make sure to hit the gym soon after :P

Ambiance is nice and calm they have separate kids play area and a party hall for celebrations. The place can easily accommodate 50 to 70 people. Coming to food we ordered 1. Garden fresh sandwich it was really loaded with some nice veggies and perfect amount of cheese and toasted to perfection 2. The veg cheese sandwich again it was yummy and had roasted mushrooms to go with onion and cheese. 3. Oreo cookie shake - Sweetness was just adequate and flavour was awesome as well though they can do something with the thickness of it as it was way watery for my liking.

It took a little bit of waiting for the order to come. The main thing was that it wasn't chill when served. I felt the milkshake would had tasted much better if was more thick. It kindof lacked that real chocolaty flavour.
