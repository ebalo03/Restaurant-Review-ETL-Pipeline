Khaan Saab,Mayank,"Had the worst service of my life. Had to wait for more than 2 hours for the main course. It was later told that there was some problem with the kitchen. They later served food when we were standing outside and waiting for the bill. This could be a one off problem, but I expected better communication from the staff, so that we could have made alternate plans instead of waiting endlessly for 2 hours when they kept telling us that food will come in the next 5-10mins.",1,3 Reviews,5/17/2019 15:16,0,
Khaan Saab,Susmitha Penisetti,"I have been to khaan Saab in Vijayawada earlier and loved the food and ambience. Hence, chose to go to this place as I wanted to eat some naan and paneer butter masala.the ambience is good and the food is just amazing. From starters to main course, food was just yum. They have got an interesting nawabi sort of menu. Prices are lightly high and that's fine for me because the taste is worth the money.

Khaan Saab,Agastyaraju Koushik,"I have been to khaan saab couple of days before before i went there i have gone through all the reviews in zomato and i was amazed with those reviews(paid reviews). The worse experience i had at khaan saab.

Cons: worse hospitality
Non friendly staff
Worse food

Even i asked for mint chutney they brought some junk from the storage and made some garbage chutney. I have paid 2000 for 3 dishes.Its totally worthless and damn.... paid reviews.

I am suggesting you to dnt take your office collegues and higher officials.",1,4 Reviews,5/9/2019 14:08,0,

Khaan Saab,Kalyan Madduru,"Khaan Saab, in Gachibowli was known for it's ambience and interesting kebab menu.

We ordered murgh sheek kabab and chicken Tikka biryani. Kebab starter was good, with minced chicken kebab. Chicken Tikka biryani was chefs special here, and rightly mentioned. Biryani was undoubtedly one of the best in the city. It was served with 6+ medium sized boneless Tikka pieces, smoky grilled and raitha. Simply loved the spice flavors in biryani.

Ambience was ok types, not so appealing. Crockery used for service was good.
Talking about most important part food,
We ordered Chingari murg patiala, which is so called their signature dish. It has so salty seems dish is coming from sea. Even chef was giving excuse about it was bone stock. But it was so salty you can‚Äôt eat.
Steam rice was salty too.

I unfortunately took my guests to Khaan Saab and learnt a life lesson - never try/experiement new places when you have guests.. üòêüôÑ

We ordered mutton galauti kebab, mirchi chicken Tikka and paneer tikka for starters.. What place doesn't have mint chutney when you serve kebabs..?! Yes, they dint have mint chutney.. And galauti kebab was so difficult to finish..

Pata soup was no better too.. In main course we ordered Tikka biryani and veg biryani.. And they dint have mirchi ka salan in this.. Tikka biryani was sweet on taste.. It actually tasted like drumstick curry to me.. Such weird analogy but true.. Raita was the only thing I liked of all..

They dint have lassi/soda or milk shakes too.. I dint even bother to click any pics.. What a way to disappoint my guests.. üôàüòÖ",1,"201 Reviews , 390 Followers",4/8/2019 22:33,3,

The staff wasn't very welcoming when we mentioned we will using DineOut for payments and you could sense their attitude change. The ambience is pretty standard and looks empty.",3,"42 Reviews , 58 Followers",2/4/2019 9:02,4,
Khaan Saab,Vasantha Lakshmi,"An all time favourite of ours. As you enter the restaurant you will find a big sized elephant near the waiting area, little ahead on the right you will find a private dining rooms.
Fantabulous ambience with great food royalty can be experienced at khaan Saab . Tundey kebab will be stand out among all other dishes and is definitely worth a try, staff were brilliant,courteous, friendly too, they even had pan, which was delicious.

Overall,it's a place to have good food and spend quality time with your friends and family ............",5,"8 Reviews , 5093 Followers",2/3/2019 17:58,4,

Khaan Saab,Krishna Bh,We went for lunch in weekday. Restaurant is with ok ambience and nizam style plates and glasses. Ordered biryani. Biryani full of masala and little rice. Jyadha masala thoda rice. Food taste is ok but not worth it. Food cost is peeeeeeekss. One water bottle cost is 47Rs. Highly costly food.,2,"5 Reviews , 1 Follower",1/18/2019 12:47,0,

Khaan Saab,Pradeep Koney,"Fantabulous ambience with great food. Royalty can be experienced at Khaan Saab. Went there for New Year's Dinner with Family and the food we tried were yummy & lip smacking. Dhahi Ki Galouti will stand out among all other dishes and is definitely worth a try. Other dishes we tried were Paneer ka Soola in Veg, Lal Mirch Ka Teekha Tikka in Non Veg, Hari Mirch Ki Roti in Breads & Angarey Jamum in Desserts. All of them were exceptionally good. Only thing we felt was prices are steep for the quantity they serve. But all is well when the food is great and ambience is awesome.",5,"13 Reviews , 118 Followers",1/2/2019 0:16,8,
Khaan Saab,Roy Burmon,"As the tag line itself says Be The Royal Guest, Khaansaab actually keeps up with it. You are indeed welcomed as a royal guest here. Filled with its authentic awesome delicacies, its an ideal place for a quality dining with family as well as friends.
Rajwada Raj Gosht is a must try, I bet you would be mesmerized by the tender lamb pieces in the spicy curry.",5,"17 Reviews , 25 Followers",12/19/2018 23:55,0,
Khaan Saab,Bharat Yagnala,"Since there was a party going on in the main restaurant we have been diverted to a subsidiary of the same.

Literally worthless. A shame to the fane of KhaanSaab.

Open doors, full of mosquitoes, no captain to advice on the order, no proper care.

Been the worst dinner experience ever. And to have that on the day of my wedding anniversary was disastrous.

Ruined my date.

Will never ever return here.

Thanks for totally ruining my date.",1,"5 Reviews , 6 Followers",11/23/2018 21:51,0,
Khaan Saab,Furkhan Shareef,"Went out for casual family dinner, tried the palak chat for starters it was yummm, worth a try. Also tried mutton galawti kebab and a fish starter. Mutton kebabs were really good, fish starter took lot of time to get served and still lacked the taste, but disappointed with the fish starter.Ordered peshawari chicken and few naans for the mains, both the gravy and naans were up to the mark. Biryani was also decent. It‚Äôs a place worth a try.",4,"20 Reviews , 757 Followers",11/18/2018 10:26,7,
Khaan Saab,Smita Singh,"Want to experience the Royal food and service?? Visit this place and you won't be disappointed. Perfect place to experience the rich favor of North Indian dishes. Ambience is good with dim lighting. Service is good with friendly staff.
Delicious food. Would highly recommend the Burani paratha. Do try other dishes too.
And yeah ambience of Banjara hills branch is better.",4,"20 Reviews , 82 Followers",11/15/2018 20:47,2,
Khaan Saab,Shashank Kale,"Ambience is good but the food needs improvement in all the aspects. Service was a bit slow too.

Khaan Saab,Tamal Sarkar,"It was a Thursday night that we decide to go to this Khaan Saab - and get the feeling of being a Royal Guest!

The ambience inside and the interiors were definitely apt to their punch line - it gives you the Royal Feeling

We ordered main course only as we were way too hungry !

Butter Naan
Punjabi Kulcha
Chicken Kurchan
Chicken Khandar

First of all I felt the pricing was a bit expensive but for the ambience and the royalty of the place I would buy it if the food is also that good!

The Butter Naan had loads of Butter to our delight and were very soft and worth it!
The Kulcha had potato filling but we expected it to be a bit more surprising given it was Punjabi Kulcha
Both the side dish had shredded chicken in gravy.
We were 7 people so while ordering when we ordered only two sides the waiter told us that one side dish suffices for only 2 or at max 3 people.
Given the price 380 we were amazed to hear this.
However we ordered only 2 and when the food arrived we understood why the waiter said so in the first place.

So we ordered one side dish later on and enjoyed the food. The taste and the quality was really excellent for all the money.

However there was another thing which stopped me from giving a 5 star rating to the place.
We asked for the bill and everything in it was justified except the charge for water

We had ordered regular water so theu gave 3 500ml Aquafina bottles and later on they gave a 1 litre bottle.

And they charged 150 for that in the bill, quite ironical when the MRP is 10 for these bottles
They charge GST and they charge water at such a idiotic price.

We clicked many pictures near the giant Elephant near the entrance. The whole place was very well decorated and I could easily spend one hour just clicking pictures.",4,"16 Reviews , 60 Followers",11/2/2018 11:20,6,
