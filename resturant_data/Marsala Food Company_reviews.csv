Marsala Food Company,Alisha Das,"Went to this place on a weekday. Then also I found this place having a crowd. This is a perfect family and friends restaurant.
The quantity of this restaurant is very nice and fulfilling. This place is good for people considering less spicy option. There are variety of dishes available here.

I ordered pahadi chicken in starter. It had this taste of spinach and it tasted good with mint chutney otherwise quite bland. But the chicken was cooked properly.
I ordered special chicken curry in main course. That was bits of small chicken in rich gravy. It was good not very awesome.
Ambience was decent.

Can explore once.",4,"51 Reviews , 141 Followers",5/23/2019 1:39,2,

Marsala Food Company,Praveen Kumar,"First time I have tried Arabian chicken soup , I feel a different taste which really exited me to have one more.
And also I ordered the fish haryali tikka , the quantity and quality of the food really gReat. Finally I tried the marsala special chicken by Having little drops of lemon juice the taste is outstanding.

Marsala Food Company,Mubeena Afreen,"Visited for lunch today. The food was so yummy and the ambience was very good.
Must try dish is non-veg Chinese platter in which we get fish, prawns, chicken drumsticks and other 2 types of chicken also. It costs around 800/- but it is definitely very much worthy. And the butter naan was so soft n nice. And the assorted chicken Mandi was also yummy.
Overall it is one of the best restaurants I have visited. Everything was satisfactory.",4,1 Review,5/5/2019 23:10,3,
Marsala Food Company,Gautam Narang,"We went for a lunch outing here. It‚Äôs located at DLF. The ambience is good and we expected a good meal. We ordered Chicken Tangdi, Mutton Biryani and Coke. First thing we got was Chicken Tangdi and what I instantly noticed was that it was deep fried, which is not a norm and wasn‚Äôt juicy; all we could taste was charcoal. This made our expectations very low.

In the mean time, I asked them to get the Coke I ordered; it wasn‚Äôt chilled. Hence, I requested them to get Ice. To my surprise, they had no ice.

And finally, we got our biryani. It was not bad; but, there were no Meaty pieces of Mutton; Only bones.

My advice to you all would be that the food is edible but don‚Äôt keep your expectations too high.",1,"7 Reviews , 5 Followers",5/5/2019 18:02,0,

Not a single stand out dish , chettinad chicken was salty and inspite of me telling them multiple times they turned a deaf ear. Deserts are so so. Biryani was fine but chicken was very dry , same case with the fish starter just horrible. Fruit custard had only bananas.even their water tasted like chemically treated.

Marsala Food Company,Mahathi Natva,Visited this place in person and also had food delivered from it. The Mandi and the biryani are some of the personal favorites. But I happened to order the egg soft noodles from the place and it tasted really good and the quantity was pretty filling. The biryani of the place is packed with flavors and accompanied by perfectly Cooked meat.

Overwhelmed with their service and courtesy 4/5
Tasty, delicious,mouth watering 4+4 starters were served which were amazing
A paradise for Biryani lovers, never expected Biryani in main course would be this amazing anywhere else
The varieties in desserts is quite different here, which included 'KA' for all-
Double Ka metta, kadu ka kheer, gajar ka Halwa, kubani Ka metta.

Marsala Food Company,Pradeep Kumar,"Well... After going through a lot of positive reviews we finally decided to visit this place. We opted to go for buffet option. The taste of the soup would have been better if it has been served hot. Coming to starters they served 4 non veg and 4 veg starters. Out of the non veg starters apart from Tandoori chicken nothing tasted great or not even good. Especially Apollo fish was not even cooked properly. Out of the 4 veg starters only panner pakoda tasted better, that‚Äôs what my vegetarian friends said. Coming to the main course they served rotis prepared with Maida which I never try. The only thing I liked out of all the main course is mutton curry. Starting from chicken biryani and sweets like Gajar ka halwa, double ka meetha everything was served cold (Probably they forgot to turn on the burners). Finally it‚Äôs ice cream time which melted even before they served on the table. On a whole it was a bad experience. I would like to suggest the management one thing, If you are not really willing to serve buffet option over the weekdays better don‚Äôt.",2,"1 Review , 1 Follower",4/24/2019 9:45,0,
Marsala Food Company,Wagsman09,"Clean and neat place for some Arabian food as we usually get to see some unhygienic places for this cuisine and mainly Mandi.

Went for lunch with a group of ten and got to order many varieties as we opted for ala carte even though the Buffet was reasonable and had many varieties.

Mandi rice was great but chicken faham isn‚Äôt soft at all. Mushroom tikka is sweet as it contains some raisins.

Marsala Food Company,Jharna Karira,"The place is overrated, we went on a Friday afternoon, it was too crowded, had to wait for 15 mins to get a table, once we got the table, order was taken after 15 mins which made it 30 mins of waiting, we had to run behind the waiter to take the order, order was then taken, we had Apollo fish, kung pao chicken and juicy mutton mandi, the fish tasted good, chicken was not cooked properly, coming to mandi, it tasted like we were having boiled mutton with rice, wasn't great at all, and the mandi was around 585rs, I'd rather spend that elsewhere and get 2 mandis for around 600.

Marsala Food Company,Abhay Hora,"I think the restaurant is over rated. We chose this place based on their zomato rating and ended up being at a place where only decent thing was the ambience.
Being a restaurant, as they call it (I would term it as a local tiffin centre).
They charge you for a buffet when what they have is the bare minimum ‚Äî 2 curries, 1 dal as their main course. BTW, ice cream served in disposable bowl was their special. üòÅ
Food was tasteless, their veg hara bhara kebab was stale. Earlier I felt their non veg would be good, probably the reason for the rating. But to my surprise, my foodie friends (non veg lovers) said it was worse than veg. mind you, it happens rarely with them, they can over rate any average non veg restaurant. But this was worse.

We ordered crispy salt and pepper vegtables as a starter which was a good portion size and enough for two people to share.
For main course we went with the recommendation of paneer lababdar with garlic naan. The quantity was enough for two people and the paneer lababdar was medium spicy. It was made just like how it is made in the North.

If you are going with Zomato gold offer, they will treat as beggar who came to eat without paying any money. Overall very worst experience. Tomato soup with weird smell. We ordered Kung Pao Mahroom as a starter but I can't feel Kunng pao taste in mashroom starter at all. it feels like mashroom chilli. We ordered Baby Corn Masala*2 and Paneer lababadar*2 as Main course and we observed that they served very less quantity compare to other tables as we have zomato gold. They added Baby corn and Paneer pieces which we can easily count. There is more gravy then vegetables, paneer and baby corns as like roadside restaurant usually serve. Even Service is really slow on regular days. I don't know how they manage on weekend. Waiters are very lazy and behaving like they are customers. Best thing is only ambiance.

Few days back we headed Marsala for dinner. The moment we entered, it was so beautiful to see lights and colors everywhere.

When the ambience is good, it already makes half the things right

We had some awesome Starters like: Arabian Chicken Soup, Paneer Papdi Kabab, Fish 65, Chicken Lahori Tikka, Golden Fried Babycorn üòã

All of them tasted heaven, but our personal fav was Paneer Papdi Kabab, Chicken Lahori and Golden Fried Babycorn üíØ

Marsala Food Company,Hayavadan Rao / The DeccanFoodie,"I visited this place with my fellow bloggers. We had all come here for lunch. A place which has been always highly rated and this visit was pending for quite some time. We all came here with a lot of expectations and Marsala Food company didn't dissapoint us at all. We tasted a lot of items on the menu. The best and my personal favorite was the kit Kat shake. It was even better than the ones you get at the other shake outlets. The lemon Coriander soup was too lemony and was a bit sour and the veg Wonton Soup was good. It is not a must try and can be avoided ! Nothing special about it ! This was the only item that wasn't very good .Deep fried panner with a lot of masala ! Undoubtedly one of the best on the menu It is a must try and the special dish of the restaurant was the fried rice . the rice is topped with few Manchuria pieces and a lot of chopped vegetables. A treat for the mouth! We also ordered the veg curry and few rotis. We were all happy with the curry and rotis . The gulab jamun and the other deserts such as the kaddu ka kher and the double ka meetha were the stars of the day. Especially the gulab jamun !
Fresh and juicy dipped in the right quantity of sugar solution ! Even the people who don't have a sweet tooth will love it! A place that is a must visit",5,"129 Reviews , 286 Followers",4/2/2019 19:07,10,

We didn't seen any difference in look between fish and baby corn. Main course is limited and are not available readily for us. We need to wait for 10min to get curries. Roti are pathetic, not fresh.

We had a mushroom Moti tikka for starter which tasted sweet and we could barely finish the starter due to its sweetness.

Marsala Food Company,Rameez Siddiqui,"Visited this place recently as it has become the talk of the town .
We started off with Paneer Papdi Kebab and Chilly Paneer with Crispy Corn and Veg Sheek kebab from the Veg starters. Extremely Delicious and my favorite was the Chilly Paneer.
The Non veg starters were haryali Fish Tikka ,Chilly Basil Prawns and Lahori Chicken Kebab.
The Chilly Basil Prawns were really good and perfect in every way.
The showstoppers were the Mutton Juicy Mandi and the Fish Mandi! Such a perfect taste of the Mandi rice. Can easily compete with Barkas Mandi Houses.
The Desserts, well we tried them all like the Apricot Delight , Shahi Tukda, kaddu ki kheer and my personal favourite Gulab Jamun.
The Awesome dish unknown to people who visit this place is the Kitkat Shake. Really Do try the Kitkat Shake.

All were amazing and more than expectation. U will find little expensive at begining.. But trust me, the quality and quantity they provides, is really value for money.

Marsala Food Company,Meha Gupta,"Visited this place for the first time (team of 7 people) after checking out the rating and reviews. Not at all happy with the management and the staff.

1. Added few items in between for which we were made to wait for more than 30min with no response whenever asked for. We cancelled the order finally and also were made to pay for the cancelled items (INR 500 extra for the items cancelled).
Reason stated by the staff - if you won‚Äôt pay, it will be deducted from our salary.
2. When asked for salad (thrice), no one served. Ultimately, one of us, went to the buffet section and got the onions. Even this wasn‚Äôt noticed by anyone.
3. Not happy with the quality of food. Ordered ‚Äúpapdi paneer kebab‚Äù as per the staff recommendation. It was dry and not good. We told the guy who served and got no response for our concern.
4. There are many staff members but lack of management.

Marsala Food Company,Tasty Hyderabad,"I heard so much about this place and i finally got to visit. I was there with few of my friends where we got to try their traditional authentic dishes.
The ambience was nice and it was very spacious with good seating arrangement. The staff is very friendly and courteous. The service is also quite fast.
We first started off with Arabian chicken soup and a Veg soup.

Then we tried their starters Paneer papdi kebab, Veg sheekh kebab, Lahori chicken kebab, Golden fried babycorn, Fish hariyali, Chilli basil prawn, Chilli paneer and Crispy corn chilli pepper.

For the maincourse we first tried Grilled fish mandi and Mutton juicy mandi. I wished mandi was more flavourful but the grilled fish which was served with mandi saved the day.
Then we tried Special fried rice with veg manchurian, Special chicken noodles with chickeb manchurian and also Veg kolhari curry and butter chicken with few breads.

We also tried few mocktails Virgin mojito, Kotkat milkshake and Chocolate milkshkae.

We finally ended our meal with few desserts Gulab jamun, Apricol delight, Double ka meetha and Kheer",5,"75 Reviews , 174 Followers",3/28/2019 12:39,26,
Marsala Food Company,Syeda @food__vampire,"It was a lunch and was very hungry thought to head towards this place.
.
.

The place is quite good with spacious sitting area and decent ambience.
.
.
There are many varities available to eat where its mojitos, soups, starters, maincourse and the desserts not to forget the softdrinks the most important thing.
.
.
Had started with the lemon corriander souo and the arabian chicken soup....the best liked by me us the lemon corriander where the flavour of each ingeredient used to make the soup was felt in each sip.
..
..
Then the best to go with is the starters which includes the variety of eatables like fish hariyali, paneer papdi kabab which was good but less salt, lahori chicken kabab which was just awesom to have the tastiest one I had in a very long time, then comes the marg achari tikka which is again can stand against lahori kabab, then fish 65 was good , the golden fried babycorn which was so srumptious and welked fried ,then the veg sheek kabab which was the worst thing I tried honestly was not at all cooked properly no salt no chilli just wet piece of vegetables felt in mouth could not even eat that.
..
..
Then went ahead with prawns which was good ,then comes the crispy corn chilli pepper which was again a good one to go with.
..
..
The main course had the mouth waterting fish and mutton mandi which was really good but can be more organised if served more hot...the fish and mutton were cooked perefectly with soft texture felt......and not to forget the veg fried rice with manchuria again makes it fit to eat
..
..
Then had the virgin mojito and the kitkat shake which were perfectly made.
..
..
The most awaited and favourite part the dessert section
Which had the gulab jamun
The shahi tukda
The kuddi ki kheer
The khubani ka mittha.
...
...
Was happy and fulled after having this many varities of dishes.
..
..
Must visit this place to have a good experience of varities of different hyderabadi eatables.

One of the best and a must try here

Marsala Food Company,Tummyful_hyd,"Recently we were invited for a food tasting session here at Marsala Food Company! We had heard mixed reviews about this place soo wanted to check out how it actually is! Well to start with, as soon as we entered we were quite impressed by their interiors and their seating arrangement! They have the Arabian style of seating i.e sitting down on with the food placed on stools and also they have the normal high table seating for people who don't wish to sit down! The place is dimly lit and very calm! You can enjoy the food with an overview of the traffic passing from infront of the DLF gate no 3, opposite to which is this place Marsala Food Company! So after we settled down they brought in the soups, we had the Arabian Chicken soup and the Lemon coriander soup! We just loved the Arabian Chicken Soup, it was really tasty and the chicken pieces were very tender! Whereas the lemon coriander soup was a bit spicy which is quite unexpected and also we felt it could be a little more improved! Next came vast spread of starters including both veg and non veg! The starters included Chicken pahadi, Paneer papdi, kung pao mushroom, Dragon chicken, Haryali fish tikka, Golden fried prawns, Golden fried babycorn, chilli paneer, lahori chicken kebab and mushroom moti tikka! Starters were really good in taste! Specially the non veg and seafood starters! Chicken pahadi, a dish prepared by marinating the boneless pieces in fresh mint, coriander, ginger and garlic paste and yoghurt, had a very refreshing and delectable taste! The chicken pieces were really tender and very properly cooked! The dragon chicken was a bit spicy and juicy but really good in taste! The golden fried prawns and babycorn are prepared by marinating them in the battered paste! These are really crispy and amazingly tasty! You definitely are going to love the starters here! ‚ù§ Next they brought their famous Mandis on our table which included Mutton Juicy Marg Mandi, Grilled chicken Mandi and Fish Fried Mandi! Although all of them were good enough the one that stood apart was the Grilled Chicken Mandi! The rice in the mandi is very flavorful and yummy! And the chicken is grilled to perfection making it juicy and tender! The quantity was also ample...it can serve 4! In between all the starters and the mandis they also served us their milkshakes which had kitkat milkshake, Butterscotch milkshake and strawberry delight! Strawberry was our favourite! Made of fresh strawberries this shake gives you a refreshing taste and also You will order for another one üòâ And at the end of it all, we were served the desserts...the desserts which You commonly see in the Hyderabadi functions! They had the Qubani ka meetha, Double ka meetha, Kaddu ki kheer and Gulab Jamun! We strongly feel that they should improve on their desserts! They were just okay-ish! Dessert is the way to Man's Heart...soo it shouldn't be taken lightly! But overall it was a good experience here at Marsala, the staff was really nice and friendly and the food except for the desserts was really amazing! Do try this place...specially for their starters and the grilled chicken Mandi! üòç",5,"18 Reviews , 271 Followers",3/22/2019 19:09,7,

Marsala Food Company,Harshita,"The food of the place was nice except for ‚ÄòMurg Malai Tikka‚Äô, the dish was very sweet and not worth for money. The reason for giving 1 star rating is my experience in the restaurant which was not only food but also the staff which were very very rude not only while serving food but also while taking order and explaining certain dishes which were named differently on the menu. The staff doesn‚Äôt know how to treat with customers they were unnecessarily speaking and poking nose in our personal conversation and behaving miserably with the people there pretending that is ‚Äúcool‚Äù behaviour.

Overall good place to order food from the last place one should go for dine in. The staff should learn how to behave with the customers.

Marsala Food Company,Tania Sahu(Mrsfoodieglobetrotter),"Went there for dinner. Tried Chicken Mandi and double ka meetha. Quantity of Mandi was good for two. Double ka meetha was average. Ambience and service was ok but could have given 4 stars if the AC could have been a little high and service a little fast. I also feel they should also take care of the taste of dishes as there are so many good competitors around.

Decent ambience
Require a bigger or brighter hoarding in order to spot the location",3,"4 Reviews , 1 Follower",3/17/2019 7:58,0,
Marsala Food Company,Karna Nair,"Today I visited this place along with a few friends.Located at the third level of a building right opposite DLF it is at an easily reachable location.The lift opens into a foyer followed by a lobby.The dining area has many seating options both low seating and normal tables too.One can view the never ending traffic outside from the low tables.The ambience is good.The place is dimly lit with pretty lamps and decorative lights.
Now coming to the food I felt the food was mostly good with only some exceptions.
We started with soups.We had the Arabian Chicken Soup and the Lemon corriander soup.The Arabian Chicken Soup was a smooth and mild soup also it wasn't that thick too.On the other hand the Lemon Corriander soup was real thick and was more spicier and had a freshness to it.Also it had baby corn, carrots, beans and such which made it even more better.
Next we had starters.Chicken Pahadi- The pahadi kebabs have all herbs as flavouring agents instead of the normal khara masalas we generally use.The pahadi kababs they serve here is really good.The flavouring was fresh and chicken was tender and easily coming apart with a slight touch of the fork.Next we had Paneer Papdi Kebab.This is batter fried paneer slices.The batter and it's seasoning was good but inside the paneer should also have had some seasoning but the paneer was bland which spoils an otherwise great dish.Kung Pao Mushroom was okayish.It tasted almost like manchurian and lacked the normal roasted peanuts which you find generally in Kung Pao dishes.Dragon chicken and Hariyali Fish Tikka both were amazing.I do recommend these.Golden Fried prawns were good but they were batter fried which took away that 'prawn' taste.It was good but did not feel like having prawns.Golden fried Baby corn was also good.Chilli Paneer was disappointing.The paneer was not soft and the dish just did work out.Lahori Chicken Kabab was also pretty good.Mushroom Moti Tikki is something I would avoid.I did not like it but I feel this is a dish that one person might love while the other will just hate it.It is khova filled mushrooms.I could not eat it and so I am not recommending this but you could give it a try.What if you are a sweet filled mushroom kinda person.
Next we had Mandis.The juicy mutton mandi was good but my favourite has to be the Chicken Mandi.The rice of the Mandis was flavourful and filled with caramelized onions and nuts.The fried chicken served with the mandi was just pure awesomeness.The pieces are fried and then again tossed with some sauces to give it a unique taste.The Fish mandi was also served with a very tasty fried fish piece.The fish was very flavourful and is definitely worth a try.The best Mandi you ask then definitely go for the Chicken Mandi.
We also had some milkshakes- KitKat,Butterscotch and Strawberry.I loved the KitKat Milkshake the most.It had chunks of KitKat in it and is served with a scoop of chocolate icecream.The milkshakes are good but they are nothing extraordinary.
Now coming to desserts. I was not that satisfied with the desserts.The Kaddu ki Kheer was really good.We also had Double ka Meetha which I feel was too dry and a bit hard too.Also the Gulab Jamuns also could improve a bit.They were not bad but not really good too.We also had Qubani ka Meetha which was okay.
Overall I would say most of the non veg starters were good and the Mandis too are good.The desserts need improvement.The place is definitely worth a visit.",5,"30 Reviews , 63 Followers",3/16/2019 22:08,27,
Marsala Food Company,Simanto Bagchi,"Customers won't really care about your ambience or service if your food quality is below par. I ordered Chicken dum biryani from here, relying on their ratings but the very first experience itself was really bad. The chicken tasted horrible and was stale. I had to throw away the biryani. You guys should check the food before delivering it to the customers as delivery of this kind of food does not only affect the ratings but also can cause serious health issues. I value food which is worth the money spent and I feel betrayed here. I contacted zomato regarding the issue and they just assured me that this won't happen again and conveyed that they have shared feedback with the restaurant. They should have issued a proper refund here. I did not expect this kind of service and I really don't look forward to trying anything from this place in future.",1,"158 Reviews , 229 Followers",3/16/2019 15:15,0,

Marsala Food Company,Rakesh ( TripAnzo ),"Sharing my experience at marsala food company as soon as you enter just have a look at the the roof decor it's just amazing and when you get in further to the seating area you'll find the regular dinning tables and chairs and then you'll also find couches and tables well as this place serves Arabian food specifically for Mandi ppl some ppl prefer seating on the couches and making themselves comfortable while enjoying their meal the decor is decent and the service was also good let me start with the food review now so I had Arabian Chicken soup which was so rich and creamy next

I got my hands on their starters like

Chicken Pahadi kKebab
Chicken Banjara Kebab
Kung Pao Mushroom
Paneer Papdi Kebab
veg seekh kebab
dragon Chicken lahori Chicken kebab all the kebabs were fine what I liked the most among the starters were Kung Pao Mushroom dragon Chicken and banjara kebab and I felt that the veg seekh kebab was a bit dry and had no flavours apart from that everything was really delicious

Getting into the main course now I tried Mutton Juicy Mandi chicken Tangdi Mandi and grilled fish Mandi I personally liked chicken Tangdi Mandi as the chicken was well marinated and spicy as I love spicy food

Treating myself with the milkshakes and Desserts now in milkshakes I tried chocolate, butterscotch and KitKat I liked the KitKat one it was so deliciously topped with a scoop of ice-cream and then KitKat as a cherry on the top and in desserts I had gajar Ka Halwa double Ka meetha and kaddu ki kheer I liked kaddu ki kheer the most there was no major difference between gajar Ka Halwa and double Ka meetha my overall experience was good the staff were friendly and cooperative all I would like to say is its a good place to hangout with your friends for a proper Arabian meal !!",5,"58 Reviews , 564 Followers",3/16/2019 1:33,19,

We found this restaurant in the third floor and thought of visiting this place becoz it is third floor and will not be much crowded but surprisingly people where waiting for seats. We ordered for chicken kebabs for starter which was perfectly cooked with awesome taste and after that we ordered chicken biryani which was came up with nice quality and superb taste with good enough quantity. By the seeing the price of biryani we got shocked and after looking at the biryani quantity surprised. Serious it was good quantity for the price.

Marsala Food Company,Chaithanya Guptha Gollapalli,"Soups: Had tomato soup and sweet corn veg soup, both especially the tomato soup along with tiny breadsticks was delicious.

Starters: Ordered crispy corn chilli pepper and Paneer papdi kebab. Was very much disappointed with the quantity they gave. We only get 4 pieces of paneer papdi kebab. It was crispy and tasty but could've used a little more spice. The crispy corn being crispy corn tasted wonderful! 

Main Course: Ordered Paneer Tikka Biryani, and Butter Naan along with Kaju Paneer. The butter naan and the curry were decent but the paneer tikka biryani was the best paneer biryani I've ever tasted. The paneer pieces were soft and creamy and the rice had a rich taste to it. Though the biryani could've used a little more spice, it tasted great! 

Ambiance & Service: This is an evening place for sure and we visited there for lunch. So couldn't really comment on that but whatever we could see looked very good. One complaint was that our seats were directly beside a bare glass and we got scorched in the sun for 40 mins before we could get a table away from it. Avoid the seats beside the glass during afternoon hours. The service was a little late but the staff was friendly. Kudos to that!

We got 2 of them as complimentary with GOLD.
starters were amazing - especially, fish was juicy with smoky flavor. Quantities of both chicken biryani full and fried rice was huge. Biryani can easily serve 3 for main course.

        Ambiance pretty normal not so catchy but i would say evenings are the best time to visit this place. Service is good, quite descent number of servers. Impressed with their work polite, calm and patient. having enough said about the service and ambiance let's skip into the food!

Veg corn soup: Touch of the sweet corn along with the hot sour soup, the veg soup tasted extremely well.

Tomato : Crispy bread crums soaked in the sweet tomato soup gives you a mouth watering feeling right when it gets to your table.

chicken soup: I would say this is the best chicken soup i ever had. Minced chicken along with the soup can give you the best taste.

Mutton shorba: Well, this is also a mouth watering dish over here, loved the taste of shorba. The hot soup served with the piece of mutton, can really make your day!!

  
Crispy Corn : Spicy enough as well as crispy enough this starter really gave us a boost! 

Chicken Spring Roll: This is where i was pretty disappointed because they failed to impress us. not really tasty though. 

Loose Prawns : Neatly washed and perfectly grilled the loose prawns were delicious resulting in craving for more.

Chicken Chettinad : well cooked well marinated with enough spices the chettinad curry really satisfied our need. 

chicken mughlai : Spicy enough, delicious enough just satisfying the need for spicy indian food, this dish never dissapoints you. 

Panner Biryani : wasn't really impressed with panner biryani though, it could do better. 

chicken Biryani: Since i am not a fan of cardamom the usage of cardamom in biryani makes me go crazy but this place and moderately put up cardamom in biryani adding it a slight flavour. I suggest it's better to ask before preparing the food.
