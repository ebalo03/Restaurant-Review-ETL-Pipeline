Prism Club & Kitchen,Prachi Pant,"Went to attend the Nucleya concert (May 2019). It was very very crowded. But the ambience is great. The interior design is definitely one of its kind. Good place to party with friends. The security is nice. Since it was a crowded evening, the only thing we ordered was a pizza, which was Okayish.",5,"25 Reviews , 133 Followers",5/21/2019 23:47,0,
Prism Club & Kitchen,Sneh Tarang Randev,"This place is lit! I totally enjoyed everything from service to set up to light, sound and the magical paper bursting thing they do towards the end. Given the current trend of clubs in Hyd, I don't find the place expensive.

They have a really cool outdoor space as well, food is amazing (tried the non veg farm pizza and Burmese rolls). Crowd is a bit mixed ( college kids, kinda 30s, 40s and 50s as well).

Prism Club & Kitchen,Bhavya Tyagi,"After hearing a lot about this place I got a chance to finally visit this. As once reaction was ""Wow"" but that went away pretty soon.
Right from the Entry there was a confusion. We did a booking through Dine Out for 8:30 pm which didn't really make sense as the table were not blocked. To figure this out we have to wait for 20 mins for the manager to come. When asked about the reservation, Manager was totally Rude and said to my wife that ""She should be happy that she got a table"". I mean WOW, it was an eye opener for us.
And at that point I realised this is one of the mostly badly managed places.

No doubt its huge with good lighting , Ambience and Dance floor but the service is pathetic.
The Food is average and costly. Nothing great in drinks. Prices are all on a higher side. 
We just got a drink and a platter and left to a much better managed and a calm place.

There is no point making such a huge place if you cant manage and talk to customers nicely. Not really sure if i would like to visit this place again even though its a hot property right now(now really sure why)",1,"46 Reviews , 74 Followers",4/11/2019 15:34,0,

Prism Club & Kitchen,Pathakastha666,"I have visited the place on 3 occasions, twice on weekends and once in weekday. Getting seats on weekends is very difficult. Also, the entry is charged for couple as well as stag, however it is covered in bill.

Pros:
1. Great ambience
2. Very big dance floor
3. Hindi music after 10pm even on week days
4. Food is Fine.

Cons:
1. Uncomfortable sitting, especially if wearing short dresses.
2. On weekends, service is very slow.

Prism Club & Kitchen,Anuraag Ravi,"Best night club in Hyderabad. Amazing hospitality, F&B and service. They have the best DJ's and recognized artists playing on a regular basis. Shoutout to the in-house DJ's who uplift the ambience with their groovy tunes. The confetti and the smoke guns are a visual treat. The centre lighting piece of the dance floor is spectacular and on of a kind (You will be glued to it). The crowd is sofesticated and a great experience to meet new people who enjoy similar taste in music. The owners have done a great job in developing the night life culture which Hyderabad was missing out on. The staff is always on their toes and are super friendly.

If you are a party freak or you enjoy good music with your drinks. This is the place to be. You will not regret it.

P.s- Space and breathing room is never a problem here and their washrooms are super clean and well lit.",5,"21 Reviews , 122 Followers",4/5/2019 4:18,0,
Prism Club & Kitchen,Mohammed Talib,"The new place in the financial district which everyone is talking about and is known for its dance floor as its USP.

I went here with my team on Friday night and booked upper deck for the same. The place no doubt is very spacious and has one of the best dance floors in Hyderabad. The light system and other props were good. It reminded me of Club Octagon in Gangnam, Seoul. Overall ambience is good with 2 levels of seating where ground floor can is suitable for small groups or couples and upper deck has sofa sets for bigger groups.

Food is just average here. Starters like paneer tikka, baby corn or chicken tikka were very greasy. Main course was also not upto the mark.

Worst thing I experienced about this place is the service.
I asked person attending us to start the main course at 8.30 pm. To which he replied it will take another half an hour to get the main course ready. It would have been fine if main course got started at the said time but after many more follow ups it started at 10 pm !! This really pissed me off and ruined whole experience.

I wanted to give 1 star but giving it 2 just because of ambience.

Prism Club & Kitchen,Sugandha Saxena,"Prism is touted to be the owner of a huge club space, and rightly so.

The place is located somewhere in Financial District, after you take a turn from the Lemon Tree hotel. I pretty much had no clue about where I was exactly, and the almost stranded road is of not much help. Until you suddenly see the big lit up sign with the word Prism inscribed on it, though conveniently covered by the bushes around it. Another 100m or so, you reach their parking yard, and finally the enter the premises after it.

A huge velvety door opens into this big sized covered arena (for a lack of better word), that tell you that it can never get overcrowded on the dance floor. The place has high tables next to the dance area, and then some couches on the far side. There is a beautifully lit up staircase, that leads to a more relaxed lounge kind of seating.

And that is just one part of it. They have an outdoor seating, where the projector is put up for the match screening, and doubles up as the smoking zone. Apart from this, they have a pool, which would be apt for a private gathering.

I am no club expert, but their light system is sure one of their USP. The DJ played majorly Bollywood that evening (it was a Wednesday), and did a decent enough job.

While the place is all decked up pretty well, the food on offer didn't impress me much.

üî∏STARTERS

üîπBurmese Roll with sweet chilli dip: A bit too oily, they were okay to munch on. They could have done with a bit more filling, though.

üîπPunjabi Paneer Tikka with mint dip: Failed to impress. The paneer was too rubbery in some places, and in others, too charred. The lingering taste was merely of chilli, and nothing else.

üî∏MAINS

üîπPrism Special Veggie Lover Pizzaüåü: The dish that fared best with me. It was thin crust and had a good amount of cheese. For the price, it may seem a bit costly, but quite worth it, as compared to other dishes.

üîπSpaghetti: Their take of spaghetti aglio olio, with mushrooms and black olive toppings. This was also decent.

üîπPenne Alfredo: This was just regular, nothing good or bad. And this also goes for the accompanying garlic bread.

I didn't find the Indian mains anything great, and needs to be improved a lot.

The dessert was another downer. Chocolate Truffle was all goey and just cream.

From the mocktails section, I chose the safest bet Go Crazy. It was a twist on the oreo shake, with the inclusion of KitKat, but it wasn't great either. Lacked the comfort of a regular oreo shake.

If you are looking for a party place, that has a happening setup, good crowd and amazing ambience, this is your best bet. But for the food, it is better you stick with safe bets such as pizzas and pastas. They would give you the best value for money. The alcohol is also a little pricey, but you wouldn't mind that in a place like this.",3,"150 Reviews , 2135 Followers",3/31/2019 14:36,17,
Prism Club & Kitchen,Vivek Jain,"By Invite

The pub is located in the Financial District in Gachibowli, the pub is currently the largest in Hyderabad in terms of area. As you enter you cross your way through a large parking space and pathway to overlook a huge monkey like figure enjoying music.

The pub feels start as soon as a glance falls on the building with colorful lights. The ambience inside is amazing and is spread over two floors with the ground floor having the huge dance floor and pubs and a seating area upstairs. The USP of the dance floor is the literally lit up chandelier made of LED rings grooving to the beat of the music also the walls have lights synced to this.

There is also an outdoor seating where you can watch your favorite matches and when bored head to the dance floor back indoor.

Coming to the Food:

Punjabi Paneer Tikka (Rs. 325):
Thick cubes of paneer marinated with mustard and curd base. Was not soft and requires lot of improvement. A strict no to this dish.

Burmese Rolls (Rs. 275):
A different kind of spring rolls filled with corn, garlic and cheese. The taste was delectable with the right balance of flavors and enhanced by the sweet chilli dip. The only issue was not that crispy and a bit more oily.

Mains:

For the mains we had Exotic Vegetables in Black Pepper with Rice, the curry was just ok had a decent flavor but didn't have the distinctive flavor of the pepper sauce in it.

Prism Special Veg Pizza:
The thin crust pizza loaded with cheese and topped with veggies like zucchini was the best main course that we had among the served. The pizza was decent in taste had not much of marinara base but was not bland either. The pizza was although not crispy as we got busy catching up the tricks performed by the bartenders.

Apart from these we were also served Veg Pulao and Meloni Tarkari curry which was completely average and to be skipped.

Drinks:

Cucumber Coriander Mocktail: The cucumber coriander mocktail was too sweet. The flavor of cucumber had dominated the slight tinge of coriander.

Go Crazy:
The blend of Oreo and chocolates was nothing out of the box and tasted like a regular chocolate shake.

Recommended Dishes:

Burmese Rolls
Prism Pizza (If you need a main course)

The place is highly average in terms of food despite being an ideal place to enjoy the night life. So is not recommended.

Prism Club & Kitchen,Asha JS,"Emerging as one of the best clubs in Hyderabad...............for those who love partying this place is indeed for you.

Plus points:-
1. Great space
2. Utilized well in terms of inner area, private section, seating's, lighting, DJ console, outer smoke area and swimming pool space for mini party gatherings and very important PARKING.
3. Dance floor is great, unless in lot of clubs its get so crowded and claustrophobic.
4. Bar counter looks absolute great.
5. Barmen showing all juggling skills, is eye candy experience.
6. Good varieties of drinks but they can improve on that part a bit.
7. Few good finger foods get you sorted for your party plans.

Minus :-

1. Food wise they need to improve as it's normal nothing special or different and price wise it's not that competitive.
2. Staff over here need bit of training in terms of hospitality, being rigid spoils the mood. A cute smile can change lot of things.............:-)

Starters :-

Chicken Lahsooni was good, garlic taste was evident but overpowered which is a good thing, served with mini papad rolls and chutney. Burmese rolls is something which I relished with corn and green chilies with some cheese stuffing it got in my favorite list. Fish fingers was too was decent enough. Pizza was good too both chicken and farm fresh pizza as toppings were loaded, but make sure you have it hot or warm as you like. They certainly need to improve the pasta and paneer tikka. 

All in all a great place for partying and events organised by Prism management - don't miss them at all. Monday to Thursday they mostly play Bollywood and commercial hits. Corporate crowd is regular as lots of Multi National Companies are in neighborhood. Friday to Sunday they have different themes like Electro, Techno and EDM so all those partyholics have a blast at this new place in Hyderabad.

Happy Partying Guys...........................:-)

Prism Club & Kitchen,Shreshth Malhotra,"An evening well spent at Prism club and Kitchen. The place is situated relatively outside the main city in Financial district and has a huge area to offer. One can enjoy Poolside as well as at the sitting which is offered near the Dance floor. With big live screens and a great DJ, there is a lot of entertainment that you can expect out of the place.

Started my food experience with their Appetizers. I tried out their Punjabi Paneer tikka, Fish Finger, Lehsooni Murgh tikka and Veg Burmese rolls. The Punjabi Paneer tikka was good. It had an exquisite flavor to it which was top notch. Served along with Onion salad and traditional mint chutney, one can give this dish a shot. Next up, their Fish fingers were quite normal for my palate. They could improve the side dip and can use tartar dip as an option. 

My favorite dish of the night was their Lehsooni Murgh tikka. It had a really fantastic smoky flavor of garlic flakes to it and was super tender. The spice mix was really complimenting the chicken and is a must try for you all. Veg Burmese rolls was a big disappointment for me. It had some extra oil to it which could have been clearly avoided. They need to work on the filling as well as the outer crust of the rolls.

For their drinks, I tried out their Cosmopolitan, Margarita and Passion. All the drinks were simply wonderful. It was truly a great experience overall to have the right kind of drinks at this place.

For mains, I had their Exotic vegetables in Black pepper sauce with Rice, Farmer Chicken pizza, Penne white sauce pasta. Exotic vegetables in Black pepper sauce was good. I usually don't like to have this at most outlets due to the overpowering taste of the Black pepper sauce but somehow these guys served it very well alongside some Rice. Their Farmer Chicken pizza was too good. Loved the overall consistency of the dish. A slight work needs to be put up in their Pasta. I didn't find it much cheesy and tasty. 

The place setup is quite big and they certainly have a good potential to improve on their food. Great place for partying for sure. Happy eating. :)",4,"275 Reviews , 1990 Followers",3/28/2019 15:38,0,
Prism Club & Kitchen,Pranay Bejjenki,"Such a pathetic experience I had in this place. 
First, I called them on their number to check if it is open at 6 PM on a Sunday. The person who received call on behave of Prism stated that it is open from 6 PM. Once we reach there by 6:30 PM, no staff was ready to respond and said who told you it is open now. The way they spoke to their customer is really annoying. ""I Don't know to whom you have called and taken the confirmation about the open hours but, as you came early I am considering you and giving a table"". Is this how low they treat a customer? 

Secondly, When requested for a good seat as there is no crowd available. The manager or a person with attitude told us ""No, there are no seats available""(In a bold manner). When I checked from Zomato there are plenty of tables available. I got pinched with irritation. Though, I felt the lighting is good and order for drinks to my friends.

Finally, Me and my friends were feeling uncomfortable with the way people treating their customer. And then, mosquitoes came into picture. There are full of mosquitoes hissing around our heads and of course no AC has turned ON. Out of frustration, we tried cancelling the food that was ordered by us and everything we ordered. They said, it is not possible to cancel the order and your order will be here in 20 minutes. I was like ""WTF"". I asked for cheque and paid the bill without having anything and left the place. Such a disappointing experience it was. I suggest do not visit this place where customers are not treated well.",1,"3 Reviews , 1 Follower",3/27/2019 14:25,0,

The place has got good dance floor... it has got many areas in it indoor... pool area ... garden area....
Visited this place for event hilight tribe booked a VIP pass entry ... from book my show app near the entry they taped a band our wrist after entering into the prism the managers over there and bouncers over there didn‚Äôt allow us to enter the area which was up , saying it‚Äôs full than okay den make us seat some where they where like stand near the bar counter it was so annoying we paid some 3000 rupees for vip entry per ticket and they don‚Äôt allow to vip area and say to stand near bar ... dan we asked the manager two give table he said u have to pay 10000 per table ..... I said it‚Äôs not mentioned in book my show app tat we have to pay for table and ur not allowing us to go up to vip area ...what is this he was like ur wish madam dan I said see we r all gals u should at least allow us to enter VIP area he was again like full dan we got really paronoid .... seee gals need safety we just can‚Äôt be in common crowd he didn‚Äôt understood tat also dan we had to make a call.... hope u understand DAN we got a table after a calll so cheap f these managers there....
than we got our personal waiter too after d call
My question is what about a common people who can‚Äôt make calls and get the work done so better develop ur managers if u have taken money for vip let d crowd enter into tat area if u don‚Äôt have place don‚Äôt issue tickets mention in book my show about booking a table separately for the amount make sure u serve the people for what u have told

The drinks and food was not that great it‚Äôs over priced compared to other top places in Hyderabad

Every one earns there money with hard work so the owner of the place plz do think f the common crowd u charge but provide dem for what u have charged hope u understand and make the changes

Prism Club & Kitchen,Sreeya Panda,"So we had gone here in a group on a weekday and the overall experience was good. The main attraction was the huge space and the lights which already set the mood. The DJ was awesome even on a weekday with a mix of hollywood and bollywood songs. The taste of food was also good. The only problem we faced was the TAT for each order. We had to wait for like over 40 mins for each order to arrive. Also, there was a discrepancy in the bill which we realised only the next day. So better be careful before paying the amount. Also, the prices were little on the higher side. Happy partying!",4,"4 Reviews , 41 Followers",2/28/2019 19:38,0,

He took us around and showed us a nice outdoor place. Karthik attended the table. He is an amazing guy. His service is impeccable. He suggested Mongolian chicken which is very fresh and tasty.

Called up this place to reserve a table for two on a Friday night. They said please walk in. No reservations required for two. The place was sparsely filled but most tables had a reservation, and the ones remaining were well ‚ÄúAbout to be reserved so you can‚Äôt sit‚Äù. If you‚Äôre less than three head to the bar because that‚Äôs exactly where they like pushing everyone to.

The service otherwise is decent but not sure why they are so finicky about holding on to a table that is not occupied .

The place is all lights and show and great for nightlife. The food is decent and the options are a plenty on both the food and liquor front.",3,"96 Reviews , 1069 Followers",2/10/2019 22:53,2,

Prism Club & Kitchen,Deepak Banka,"Pros:
Awesome dance floor with stunning lighting and a giant screen.
Cool ambience.
They always have the best DJs.
Cons:
Too much Vip culture. Almost all the tables are reserved. It's almost impossible to get a table. You are told to get a place in the bar counter but there also, its always packed and if you would find one empty space and go and stand there, you would be told that even that space of bar counter is reserved and that bar tender is also reserved to serve only the VIPs. Even if you somehow managed to order, standing in that cranked space you won't be able to enjoy the food. Entry fee is 2k with 500 cover charge. After paying that you would atleast expect a place where you can stand and enjoy your food and drinks.

But hey if you love dancing, there's no place in the city with better dance floor and music than this.",4,"18 Reviews , 99 Followers",1/29/2019 20:09,0,

Prism Club & Kitchen,Ashok Choudhary,"I have been on Friday night and reached at round 10pm.
It was almost full we hardly get space for standing.
They occupied huge space and designed interior amazingly which definitely deserve a cover charge as its into business but one thing which nowhere make sense to taking 500 bucks for just entry out of 2k when every items price also decent to take your business ahead.
We could not order any snacks except one as we had to carry on hand and could spoil our party mood.
I must say either they should revoke their concept of charging for entry or should be take responsibility to offer seats atleast when you are visiting as couple or in group.
Dj was playing good track and it was enjoyable moment we spent.
Zomato is showing 1200 for two ppl which is really surprising üòÇ even though you cant step down to this place until unless spend 2k bucks so be aware and keep your pocket tight as this place is not for normal class people üòâ.",3,"90 Reviews , 289 Followers",1/26/2019 16:35,1,
