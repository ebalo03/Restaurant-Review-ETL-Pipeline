Asian Meal Box,Siddharth Kushwaha,Meal box are value for money. The tossed noodles are soft and much healthier than fried and chicken quality is also good. The only con is that chicken is not spicy even after selecting the spicy option. Overall taste is good.,4,3 Reviews,5/23/2019 18:10,0,

Asian Meal Box,Dristy Debanjana Panda,"I was craving for some chinese food before exam day and ordered from Asian Meal Box. It was the first time I ordered from this place. I couldn't believe when the food turn out to look the same it looked in pictures upload by them.
I ordered Gobi chilli and tossed noodles combo(medium) together with one gobi chilli extra.
Veggies overloaded in noodles and the sweet,sour and spicy flavor in gobi chilli was astounding. It's been 2years in Gachibowli and this turned out to be the best chilli and noodles I have ever had here. The garlic aroma in gobi chilli and the sourness was remarkable.
Medium combo is best for a hungry adult. I don't know about mini combo as I didn't order it.
Highly recommended place.",5,"4 Reviews , 3 Followers",4/26/2019 7:14,0,

Asian Meal Box,Renuka Nair,"Food looked so yum!!! But sadly I could have only two morsels because then I realized that my ""pure"" veg fried rice and paneer had scrambled egg ""remains"" in it. Not one whole egg, so that I can at least remove it (I am not repulsed by egg, chicken would have been a different story, of course!) But this was bits and pieces mixed in the rice and gravy. No way to remove them.

I would recommend this place to non vegetarians. Order veg and get non veg for the price of veg!

Vegetarians beware!!!

I have just added the initial pic with the big piece, the rest small pieces in the rice, I did not have the patience to click or pick.

Asian Meal Box,P Arora,"Mini Chinese Cravings... This is the place to order. I ordered Gobi Manchurian with Tossed Noodles & Veg Hot and Sour Soup
. Received it in well packed box, which is sufficient for one foodie. The soup was spiced fine and was delicious to order again. Same goes with noodles but would prefer to get some less black pepper next time. 

While everything seemed and tasted good, Gobi Manchurian missed the spot. Under impression of regular Manchurian balls i ordered this meal box but got regular Gobi dipped in Manchurian sauce. This spoiled the whole taste as at each bite you taste Gobi instead of Manchurian sauce. A new way but not for me.

Foodance just warmed up for soup and noodles.

Chinese cravings and I found this place to order!! I will now be a frequent customer of this chinese place because i loved my food. I ordered paneer Manchurian with tossed noodles. After discount i got them for 120 bucks which is a decent amount to pay for a meal for one. The quantity was not a lot but yes sufficient enough for one person.

The noodles were perfectly cooked. Rightly chopped veggies in right amount. Right sauces, perfectly sour. I loved the noodles.
The paneer Manchurian was a little on the drier side to go with the noodles, the paneer was a bit stiff too, but the gravy was amazing.

All in all it was a happy meal üòÉ Must try!!!

1) the rice was semi cooked, it was not even boiled properly.
2) the paneer portion was absolutely insufficient to complement the quantity of rice.
3) the paneer tasted disgusting and it was absolutely dry though I had requested for some gravy.
4) You guys charged me for the ketchup which was never found in the package.
Despite my horrible experience, I am trying my best to be respectful about my feedback.
If you guys have even a little bit of integrity, kindly initiate a full refund on my meal. I really regret giving you a chance to serve me and I will not repeat this mistake again.",1,"10 Reviews , 1 Follower",9/15/2018 22:49,0,
