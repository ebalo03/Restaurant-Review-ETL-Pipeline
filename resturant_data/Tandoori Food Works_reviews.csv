Tandoori Food Works,Asha Akunuri,"Very less priced restaurant located in SLN terminus. Ordered tangdi kebab and chicken tikka biriyani .
Tangdi kebab dint meet the expectations . Bit oily and taste was ok but the mint chutney served with it was delicious .
Chicken tikka biriyani was good . Chicken was tender soft and biriyani flavour was good .
Zomato gold is applicable here so it costed only 200 bucks for two . Quite impressed with it . ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Service was quick .",4,"47 Reviews , 60 Followers",5/20/2019 11:53,2,
Tandoori Food Works,Krishnakanth M,"Very pleasant experience at TFW. The stuffed tangdi kabab was fantastic. Succulent, mildly flavoured and a great salad to go with it. The sizzler biryani was a great innovative touch right down to the well cooked cabbage base. It added a new twist to the term biryani. Definitely a must visit.",4,"5 Reviews , 1 Follower",5/14/2019 21:09,0,
Tandoori Food Works,Gauri,"Ordered chicken tikka from here. Never had itna oily chicken tikka in my life. The oil was dripping uncontrollably from the box, the packing was bad.

Tandoori Food Works,Ha,"Order regular paneer tikka briyani from this place which costs rs 250/-. The briyani was good but the paneer was not so fresh and the quantity was very less. It just fills one person stomach, if someone's appetite is high then they would regret if they order food from this place.

There were two sizes, small (Rs:160/-) and regular (rs:250/-). Obviously one would think that small fills one person and regular would fill two. But No!

Very disappointed with the portion of food that they serve.

The Raitha was really tasty!! I hope they increase the portion for the amount they charge.",3,"86 Reviews , 145 Followers",3/26/2019 2:33,1,
