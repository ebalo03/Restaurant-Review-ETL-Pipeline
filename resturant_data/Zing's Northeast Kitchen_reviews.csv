Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Debopam Majumder,"The best place in Hyderabad to have Pork and beef together. Amazing taste & quality of meat, a paradise for north eastern cuisine lovers, Zing's serves large varieties of non-veg dishes in a pocket-friendly budget. Just a reminder, this is not a place to have vegeterian foods. I have read many reviews explaining how the vegetarian people were apalled by the smell of raw/ cooked meat while visiting this restaurant. They are very misleading and misinformative. First of all, you shouldn't be here if you are looking for veg momo or veg fried rice. Period.
I tried almost every pork starters and every mocktails available in their menu. Not once I have been disappointed. Every food items is tasty enough to deserve 5 rating.
The one little place for improvement could be to increase the number of staffs. Due to excessive demand, they find it difficult to cater to everyone at the same pace, hence you'd find many reviews telling how their service is slow, how people waited for 1 hour after ordering for food to show up. Personally, i've never experienced such delay.

P.S. They cook amazing Ramyun Noodles.",5,"13 Reviews , 141 Followers",5/5/2019 15:36,4,

Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Soumith,"This place has been a bookmark for me since very long as there are only few places which can serve pork. After seeing all those positive reviews in Zomato, I decided to give it a try.
I along with 3 of my friends went on a Friday Eve to this place.

Appetizers :

1. Deojikalbi : This is a pork appetizer, we loved it very much and repeated the order. For the second time, we asked the restaurant staff to increase spice levels in the dish which turned out to be really delicious.

2. Pork ribs : I did not enjoy this dish really much. Meat was tender but the sauces they used did not satisfy my taste buds. I dunno if north-east people love this type of food but it's ok, it was my first time.

3. Pepper chicken : Due to unavailability of lemon grass chicken, we had to order this appetizer. Taste was good , nothing fancy.

Main Course :

1. Ramyun with Pork : we ordered 2 rumyun with pork, taste was good but we liked the other dish which we ordered.

2. Soba noodles with pork and veggies : This dish tops the list. Luckily, I am the one who ordered this dish and my friends were having ramyun.
Soba noodles have a dark sauce and intense taste compared to ramyun. If tasted really delicious. I cannot say how perfect this dish is.

3. Naga-chicken rice : When restaurant staff placed this dish on our table, I saw chicken was undercooked. I asked the same to them, they said this is how north-east people like to eat, a bit chewy. I thought chalo let's try it, but chicken was so chewy that it's taking 5 minutes for me to complete a small piece of it.
I was disappointed with this dish.

Overall experience :

Food : 3.5 / 5
Service : 3/5 ( it was too slow)
Ambience : 3.5 / 5 (cute lil place but gets crowded on weekends)

I will definitely recommend this place to everyone. Sometimes we need to surprise our taste buds with some new cuisine üòúüòã and this place has got delicious food too.",4,"25 Reviews , 19 Followers",5/5/2019 12:17,1,

Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Bastab Chakraborty,"Couldn't resist posting this review. Has been visiting this place since the time it opened - has been there multiple times. Never before felt this urge of posting a review since the food always stood out and dominated the service.

But nothing changed over the time in terms of service, rather it's turned worse over time. There can't be an excuse of quality of food in exchange of service. If food is the only yardstick, they fail to beat that as well. Dishes are pretty authentic but equally monotonous in taste.

As a customer, I would rather not visit to wait for two ordered dishes for an hour. Worse food that can be had sooner is always better than slightly better food with infinitely worse service.",2,"36 Reviews , 95 Followers",5/1/2019 22:38,0,

Zing's Northeast Kitchen,"Ashisha, The 'Bon Viveur'","A fine and cute place like that of a cottage to have variety dishes!

Drinks:

1. Berry blast: Loved it, i would say it is my version of a drink. The right maroon version of the combination of the flavor of sweetness more than sour.

2. Green ice mountain mojito: You can find green apples in this drink. A little sour, although i liked it.

I would like to suggest to bring the drinks along with the main course rather than us having to wait and ask for it after the main course.

Teriyaki chicken: served with flavored rice. Nothing special about its taste. This is a thumbs down comparing to the other dishes i had.

Beef & Pork kimchi bokkum bap: I just liked the flavor of the rice. Both of it had a unique taste although both appeared the same. They were mixed with the right quantity of pork/beef. The piece were eatable, and not much chewy.

Pork & Beef Naga chilly curry: The flavor of these were almost the same although beef and pork has its own taste. The taste was fine with the right amount of chilly spiciness. The gravy is ravishing as well.

Service: Just fine. The waiter didn't have a pleasant look on taking our order/serving us.

Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Wei-Ting,"A little understaffed when I visited on a Friday evening, and while the food lived up to its usual great standards, I was kind of bummed out that all of their salads and their spinach and mushroom dumplings were unavailable. I have not been able to order a salad in the 4 or 5 times I have been here. Kudos to the team for their effort, nonetheless.

Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Devrath Khara,"Went there after hearing a lot of buzz about this being a go to North Eastern place, but such a bummer!
Ambience : 1star: the place doesn't not have exhaust or ventilation and has only 2 ACs which seemed to not work. it's connected to the kitchen so was smelling of the meat. No music. We were asked to occupy a table which had used plates still kept.
Service: 1 star. The staff didn't seem very welcoming and had be prompted twice or thrice before they attended to us.
Not to mention it took them 30 minutes just to get the mocktails(we already read about their slow service so was expecting it)
Non veg food: momos were very average like that of zomos may be.
Veg: the ramyum noodles were literally veg Maggi! Very misleading name and price.
Veg kimchi rice was stale and smelling of old rice.",2,"3 Reviews , 4 Followers",4/19/2019 22:59,0,
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Avishek Banerjee,"This place should realise that a dine-in restaurant has to provide some basic service and just having decent food is only the starting. The place offers good for nothing snobbish service by staff that cannot communicate and who don't give a damn about you. You can die asking for something and you won't get it. They don't even bother to keep cutlery at the table, not even tissue papers. The AC does not work and on a summer afternoon the place is like an oven.

Coming to food. If you manage to get what you like on the menu, it is a miracle. They open at 11.30. We asked for their weekend only dishes on a weekend at 1.30 and were told very unapologetic, rather rudely that they don't have it. Finally after we managed to find something that we liked and they had, we were told it would take 35 mins because a party of six had placed a big order. Now the taste. The ingredients are very good and fresh. The quality of pork is great. The taste doesn't have much variation. Everything is super spicy with just the proportion of sauces being different. After a while the taste buds just go numb with the spice. If this is how the food of North eastern India is, well, I'll avoid that geography. And I'll surely avoid this eatery. There is no excuse for bad and rude service!",1,"85 Reviews , 414 Followers",4/14/2019 15:02,0,
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Jay Mehta,"This was on our list of places to eat in Hyderabad for a while, but what kept us not going is the popularity with Meat! I am a vegetarian and wondered what i will get, seeing bibimbap on the menu , i had to try it.

We ordered fried tofu appetiser and bibimbop and freshlime+square.

Drinks were as displayed, tofu was bit disappointing..it was literally fried tofu with sauce on it and sesame seeds..can miss this if you plan to go.

Do definitely try the bap! Tasty and filling, great portions of the veggies, rice, sauce...although rice wasnt sticky and i thought dolsot bap always came with hot claypot..nevertheless tasty!

In the middle of the meal we asked for hot sauce and there came the sauce very tiny quantity, we were like WTF..the sauce was HOT made from naga chillies yet sooo good..burned my tongue but loved every bit of it..so if you have rice remaining give this a try as well.

Staff were courteous as well.

One star less just for the tofu. Rest was perfect

Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Ryan DSilva,"This place came with high recommendations from a food expert in the industry for the last two decades or so.

Visited Zing‚Äôs Northeast Kitchen on a Saturday afternoon for lunch and I wasn‚Äôt disappointed at all. We ordered for :

Roast chilly lamb - dry preparation of sliced roast lamb with chilli, ginger, bell pepper and garlic. The lamb was sliced thin, with a mildly spicy sauce and stir fried with vegetables 5/5

Deoji kalbi- succulent, spicy pork belly fried with kochujong sauce. The pork melted in the mouth. Beautifully prepared 5/5

Steaky pork ribs (available only on weekends) - the pork would just come off the bone. A weekend special !! 5/5

Kalbi bokum- sweet and spicy beef fried with vegetables 4.5/5

Dotsol Bibimbap - hot crunchy rice mix with beef chicken pork and vegetables and khimchi topped with a sunny side up. A special mention of the khimchi which complimented this rice dish so well 5/5

All downed with non-alcoholic (Coolberg) beer.

Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Bongo Lawlona,"Starters:
üç¥Kalbi Bokum (Sweet and spicy beef fried with vegetables)
üç¥Butter Pepper Garlic Prawns (Prawns toasted in fresh herbs, lime, pepper and chilly flakes)

Main course:
üçΩÔ∏è Naga Steam Fish (made with Naga bamboo shoot and chillies as well as fresh herbs and tomatoes)
üçΩÔ∏è Teriyaki Chicken (served with flavoured rice and green vegetables)

Drinks:
üçπSummer Time and Summer Lime (Orange juice served with fresh orange, mint and lime, commingled with masala)
üçπFresh Lime Soda (sweet)

Of the four dishes listed above, the first three were recommended by Madcapmanikin. And even though I trouble her ever so often for being so nitpicky about food, the woman does know good food. She hasn't been off with her recos even once. But Zing's came highly recommended by Suchismita Chatterjee Dutta as well, the other lady whose suggestions have always been on point.

In all honesty, when the starters arrived, I felt that the portions were quite small. I couldn't taste the prawns (because allergies), but the Enlightened One felt that they could've been a tad fresher. And even though the waiter told me that the #KalbiBokum wasn't too sweet, I could've lived with even lesser sweet and a bit more spicy.

But believe you me when I say that the main courses changed the game completely. The first taste of the spoonful of rice mixed with the curry converted my brain into mush. The explosion of flavours in my mouth was orgasmic!!! I literally closed my eyes with that spoonful and they remained closed for the rest of the meal. The raw mango slices, the fresh fish, the tangy tomatoes, oh! The side of blanched beans worked so well to cleanse the palate between mouthfuls so that one could experience the flavours over and over again. And the mashed potatoes that tasted of dried fish (shuntki maachh) just slayed this Bangal!

It was only by the end of the meal that I realised the starters were portioned well enough to awaken the taste buds but not fill us up. The quantity of the main courses did that ably and optimally!

Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Divya Iyer,"We wouldn't have found this gem of a place if we hadn't been at the mall opposite and looking for a place to have lunch. More than a month since we visited, but it was such a treat! The place is tiny, right on the road but still can be missed out if you are not looking for it.

The menu is pretty extensive, but going by our love for pork, we dove right into the traditional pork dishes on offer. We ordered Soba noodles with pork and veggies, Naga Pork curry (which came with rice) and then added some smoked fried pork with bamboo shoots.

The noodles were alright, but had sort of a maggi consistency - but there was enough pork to enhance the flavor. The naga pork curry was a revelation - spicy but so full of flavor, my daughter who is averse to spices ate a fair bit! The fried pork was delicious too, but an overkill, going by how we were already full with the first two dishes. 

We had ordered the flavored beer they have, which was refreshing but relatively overpriced. But just for the food, I think we need to visit again. Highly recommended for the cuisine they have on offer!",4,"13 Reviews , 50 Followers",2/26/2019 15:03,0,

Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Tanmayi Mohan,"Having heard a lot about this place and my curiosity to try a new cuisine that's a part of India, but different from the other usual cuisines, led me and a bunch of my friends to Zing's for dinner.

First up, we were greeted with a distinct smell of raw pork which was mildly unpleasant. The starters were quite good- spicy chicken momos and the pork preparations (pork belly and some kind of chilly fried pork).
The main course, however, was disappointing, or perhaps we expected something else. The Ramyum noodles tasted like a bland version of Top Ramen and the noodles had a strange texture to them. There was not enough broth either (which you tend to expect from any kind of ramen noodles). The Teriyaki chicken rice was a tad too sweet for my palette personally.

The best thing would be the prices- everything is so resonably priced, it's not easy to find non-veg (especially pork, beef etc) at these prices!

One major area of feedback would be the service. They have an extremely laidback, dont-really-care attitude, and it took a bit of effort for us to get their attention and get them to the table each time.

A little more effort from the management and they could be do loads better than they are currently- maybe even start a franchise :)

Sweet and simple place with pretty cozy ambience. People who serve food are very friendly but there were only 2 people who were serving food so our order came really late.

Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Veggie-Lover,"First things first:
Decent food. Average Service. Affordable pricing. Big on non vegetarian delicacies.

Small place with cute interiors serves up some mouth watering momos, bruschetta and Ramen.
Good things take time, especially if it‚Äôs a newbie kitchen trying to serve you food. Be patient. The service is slow but the food is good.

If you‚Äôre looking for a bowl of north Eastern style of Ramen, try their version of it. Simple, soupy and well spiced. It‚Äôs a bowl of comfort. Let‚Äôs not get your hopes high just yet. It‚Äôs their version of it and not an attempt to mimic the classic ramen that is usually popular otherwise.

The momos are good, soft and melt in the mouth- must try. They run out of the vegetarian ones rather soon.


Overall it‚Äôs a small place. Give it time, nurture it. Go for the experience.",3,"96 Reviews , 1069 Followers",1/17/2019 21:02,3,
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Vasudev Singh,"Hard to get hold of their attention. After a number of visits I now have come to terms that, it  usually takes 10-15 mins for them to come tend to you. Heck even a glass of water takes time to come to the table. Service needs to get better ! 

Anyways coming to the food, a great place for most things pork. My favorite dish which is something I totally gorge over is the Bosam. Nicely sliced pieces of pork belly, kimchi and tender pices of chillies. Each bite is a bliss. The kimchi pork fried rice is good too though I wish they could improve upon the quantity of pork in the dish.",3,"37 Reviews , 304 Followers",1/17/2019 16:43,0,

Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Rajat Goel ‚ú≥Ô∏è,"Having heard a lot of hype surrounding this place, and the 4.5 rating on Zomato, it was on my wishlist for ages, but I was always skeptical of the taste, being too authentic and a totally new cuisine. The former proved to be true, and was the primary reason I didn't have a very pleasing dinner.

It's a small and cute little diner like Cafe, with minimalistic and soothing interiors. The sour smell of fermentation was nauseating initially, but I got used to it in just a few minutes. Some room freshener would do the trick.

The items are priced very cheap, I had high expectations, but only to learn later the portions are just too small. We had:

üçó SPICY DRUMS OF HEAVEN (140/5) - The only thing I could properly finish. A typical batter fried chicken. Almost south Indian and spicy in taste, but the coating was too thick.

üçó CHICKEN SUCCULENT YAKITORI (130) - 3 skewers with tiny chicken chunks, spring onion stem and a sesame seed drizzle. Texture was good, but taste, average. Sticky barbeque sauce coating it felt like.

üçó CHICKEN MOMOS (130/5) - Standard, good amount of filling, with a very pungent ginger flavor. The coating was thick too. Chilli chutney served alongside was not too spicy, and went well with the Momos.

üêΩ BOSAM (170) - It was my first time trying pork belly, and I can't really judge, but it felt fatty and gooey. The pieces were drenched in grease. Served with spicy kimchi which I loved.

üçú CHICKEN RAMYUM NOODLES (180) - Big bowl of noodles, what looked like Maggi but was only a close resemblance. Scarce chicken pieces, undercooked, dry and hard noodles, and overall a very bland taste.

üêü NAGA STEAM FISH (250) - This was the thing causing the smell in the restaurant. And I couldn't tolerate it. A very very pungent and strong odor. The fish had a great texture and was steamed to perfection. Served with steamed white rice.

Whatever I mentioned about the food, was just my impression, and maybe because it was the first time trying out this new cuisine, I didn't really like it.

However, one thing that was disappointing was the service. It was slow and just took ages. Once the food arrived, it was fine but again the bill took more than 20 minutes.

As many others have already said, I guess, the strong point of this place is their pork preparations, and I would recommend this place purely for that. An elaborate menu with lots of options, priced well.

Here's my overall SCORE:
Food - 3.5/5 (not judging what I tried first time/don't know about)
Ambience - 4/5 (get a room freshener!)
Service - 3/5
VFM - 4/5",4,"148 Reviews , 3383 Followers",1/15/2019 1:07,8,
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Oindrila Dutta,I would give a negative star if possible for their hygiene and service. We ordered our food at 9:30PM and after an hour's wait they come and say that what we ordered from the menu isn't available.

Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Anvesh Alluri,"Had a lot of expectations after checking out the positive reviews for Zing's. There was some weird smell when we entered the outlet which was a bummer. We asked for momos which were not available. So we got lemongrass chicken and the portion size was very disappointing and shocking. Drums of heaven was another appetizer that we ordered which was below Average. We then ordered Ramyuen noodles which was tasting and looking very similar to maggi. We also got ohm fried rice which was very bland and tomato ketchup was used for presentation. The waiter who took our order looked disinterested. So, I really don't understand what the hype is about.

Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Deepa Mallick,Love for asian food brought me to this place. This place would accomodate 30 -35 people at once approximately. Food are well made with almost authentic taste. Tried Pork Momos which tasted really good specially the pickle that goes well with momos and you would not find it anywhere else in Hyderabad as per my knowledge. After that we ordered Dotsol Bibimbap which was a colorful food which would please your eyes and ofkorse your savory mouth and fill your stomach for sure (depends how much you eat :P I was full with one bowl) . One more dish that we had ordered was Ramyun Noodle which I felt almost like maggie with a very slight difference but it was soothing and filling. Only thing that had disaapointed me was the late service. We almost had to wait for 40 mins for our food.,4,"6 Reviews , 13 Followers",12/26/2018 17:45,0,
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Sourav Ghosh,"This tiny joint serves excellent Northeastern & East Asian food. Their Beef Curry with Naga Peppers is heavenly. Deojikalbi was excellent as well. The Beef Soba Noddles was also good, though less so than the other two items. The portion sizes are a little small, but then again the prices are pretty damn cheap as well. The one area where they can improve is the speed & efficiency of service, but since it's fairly new & has a very small staff at this point (possibly family run ?), I'm optimistic that they will improve as they mature.",5,"63 Reviews , 53 Followers",12/26/2018 1:22,0,
Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Foodie Chaudhary,"I seriously didn't understand the buzz around this place. Decided to have Sunday lunch here owing to the good rating of this place. The staff didn't really give any attention and we had to find a table for ourselves.
Many items on the menu were not available even on weekend and we settled for veg clear soup, mushroom & spinach soup to start with. The quantity of soups was a bummer and it was a huge bowl quarter filled with soup. If they plan to serve this quantity then they should switch to smaller bowls to atleast give illusion of a filled bowl. Mushroom & spinach soup tasted like Maggi /Knorr soup and not fresh.
For starters we opted butter pepper garlic prawn. It was served in a small plate with even smaller portion. 5 tiny prawns for starter definitely doesn't justify. The taste was average , better than soup.
For main course we decided Dotsol Bibimbap and Naga Chicken curry. Main course was way better in taste and we really liked Bibimbap. Naga chicken was good in taste but had mostly bones.
The portion size is major disappointment here and its evident across all courses. Another point of concern is their service. Be it taking order, suggesting food or even table service, the staff is not really helpful and takes forever to respond.",2,"118 Reviews , 2042 Followers",12/25/2018 18:51,9,

We ordered a teriyaki chicken bowl, Ramyan noodles, bruschetta and Doenjang Jjigae. We absolutely loved the Jjigae, which is similar to a vegetable stew and absolutely rich with flavours. The teriyaki bowl and noodles were definitely above average. They served the teriyaki bowl with saut√©ed spinach on the sides, perhaps more vegetables would have been better.

The staff isn't good at recommending dishes. The Beef curry with Naga chilli isn't good, probably because they had overused some condiment giving it a bitter taste. The pork belly was good. Beef fry wasn't great because meat was undercooked. The steam country chicken curry was good.

I would give this restaurant another chance and come back again because I really love the food from the north east and then order something which would be actually good and worth the rating it boasts right now.",3,"11 Reviews , 80 Followers",12/11/2018 22:45,0,

We visited this place when it had just opened and we were surprised with the quality of the food. For starters, we had pork momos. Everything including the presentation was perfect. Beef Soba Noodles and Teriyaki Chicken Rice alongwith Roasted Chilly Lamb and each one was competing with the other for a place in our hearts. The beef had a lovely texture and was well cooked. It was a tad on the bland side but tasted great nevertheless.

Food: 4/5 The pork dishes are awesome and the noodles were delicious. This is one place where though your stomach is full your heart wants more. Only thing I do not like is the noodle that they use. Feels like instant noddles and I feel this could be better.

Service: 3/5 Service is very slow. They seem to be a family run restaurant and sometimes (which is more often than not) when they are busy Service can be very slow. They have to very soon hire some more helping hand if they continue to experience this much of demand.

Ambiance :  3.5/5 Simple and minimalist interiors of a north eastern roadside joint.

We planned to try anything but options in pork so we ordered pork belly with veggies n kimchi salad. The particular dish is supposed to be consumed is a unique fashion. The pork belly, veggies and kimchi are to be placed on the lettuce leaf and wrapped. This combination is delicious and you would love it. Next we had smoked pork ribs which i assume had barbecue sauce and sesame seeds and tastes pretty soft tender and yum. The beef curry and steamed rice was decent but extremely spicy. You can specify how spicy you want your dish and they can suggest or customise their dishes.
Ambience is nothing but ordinary and it draws a decent crowd even on weekdays.

Zing's Northeast Kitchen,Aparajita Chowdhury,"We went on a weekend to this place as we had been wanting to try out this new place in town for a while.

Starting of with the pros, the decor and ambiance of this place is really good. The menu is quite interesting too, and includes a variety of chicken, pork, beef and some fish dishes. There are a few vegetarian options, but I do not know to what extent it would satisfy a vegetarian. They have a good choice of mocktails as well, and each one was really good. The pork ribs and the mushrooms were good too. The staff there was good too.

Moving on to why I chose to give this a bad review- first of all, the service was really slow. Took about an hour for my food to arrive. Moreover, my chicken noodles tasted exactly like Maggie with a few chicken pieces thrown in. I had attached a picture of it for reference. Moreover the portion sizes are quite small in relation to the price of the dishes. A small bowl of beef curry was 200 and one plate of steamed rice was not even enough for two people. Even though the taste was good, because of the portion sizes and the relative prices plus the service time our experience was ruined.

4. They had less staff.

So done with the negative part and the positive thing is that you get to have pork there which is rare in this area and the food is not that great but kinda okay. If you wanna try something new and also spend some extra bucks then go for it. Not much of a satisfactory feeling here. 2 stars for the delays and less quantity of food in fat ass price.

Folks at the restaurant were least bothered in taking our order right since we sat down on an empty table. Half of the food items on the menu weren't available, maybe they need to shorten the menu just to include items that are available round the clock. We had ordered pork with bamboo shoot, which I have had quite a lot of time at my hometown (Siliguri), unfortunately, this wasn't nearly as good as I had before. Although I won't judge the restaurant based on just this item, as chances are it was a one off case. But the service and staff attitude was a real put off.
