Owm Nom Nom,Sravani,Veg biryani they serve here is too good and loved it....located very well nearby to IT sector DLF gate 3. Can be more better and improvements can be made as demand is high in this area,3,"10 Reviews , 10 Followers",5/22/2019 14:07,0,
Owm Nom Nom,Nagendra Reddy Nallamilli,"Very bad biryani. Ordered fry Biryani but they brought Dum Biryani. Instead of changing they mixed and made food so much worse.

Don't encourage such restaurants where customers are not treated well and food is as bad as it gets",1,"2 Reviews , 13 Followers",5/20/2019 14:14,2,
Owm Nom Nom,Santosh,"Worst experience ever. Food was spoiled and the same was informed to the staff but not even got a response from them. Atleast they should have some concern on the customers. Even after informing about the taste, they just handed over the bill without even checking my issue. This type of service won't earn anything. This will be my last visit to this restaurant.",1,"4 Reviews , 3 Followers",5/19/2019 22:07,0,

Owm Nom Nom,Preetham Kumar Myadam,"This place doesn't even deserve 1 star.....!!

The worst ever experience which I have ever faced.....
Zero taste, zero service, NO ac nor fan, the staff has no basic respect nor they are worried about the customer.

The food served was rotten & no proper hygiene was maintained.

The Restaurant manager Mr. Anwar was rude towards customers don't know why they are running this hotel.

Completely ZERO.",1,"9 Reviews , 242 Followers",5/3/2019 14:20,0,

Owm Nom Nom,·¥Ä…¥.·¥è·¥õ ú·¥á Ä.s·¥á…¥,"The waiters are super slow, the cutlery used in the restaurant are not even clean. Hygiene is a big issue here. Coming to the food, it's nothing extraordinary except the fact that the taste is close to home made food. But again, the usage of oil is much more. Biryani and tandoori are the safest options here. Keep a track of what you are ordering because the bill might not come right. Check it before paying. I found a dish added in the bill which I did not order. When pointed out, the waiter seemed to be confused.

This place, if it has a target of surviving,needs to improve a lot in terms of food taste, consistency, service and most importantly, hygiene.",2,"685 Reviews , 794 Followers",3/31/2019 13:06,0,

At the time of serving food the waiter told us paneer is there but paneer tikka is not available and the hilarious part was we did not order paneer tikka, so what we ordered in veg in that also it did not had paneer. At the time of billing they create a lot of chaos...

Owm Nom Nom,Right Fooodies,"Place located just opposite of DLF gate no 3, which is very much easy to reach. Just reached this place to explore some of their expertise dishes and found lost !
Food quality and staff slowness made me horrible.
Seems they have done some renovation recently, which give something new and good feeling. But to be honest, in a restaurant people visit for good food followed by service. And if this is not maintained then there is no meaning ..!
All the best guys and please do some deep thinking and improve the food quality and service part.",1,"72 Reviews , 2078 Followers",3/5/2019 12:26,0,

Chicken kadai curry was not tasty at all .Chicken seems to be old stock. Veg rolls looked like Dosa roll instead. Rolls should be crispy with stuff not coming out. Didn't like the food at all .

Have been this place to several times, just because of the taste of the food, and with the hope that staff behavior would improve, but always I come back dissapointed..

Food-4/5 Main course at this place is very good. Biryani is not out of this world but tastes good.

Ambience- (3.5/4)
The restaurant as a whole has gone renovation and it's upgraded to become ""ok"" type ambience

Service-2/5
Very slow, staff are super rude and they don't give a damn about anything.

It's a good place to order to home as you need not bear with these mannerless uncultured staff.",3,"84 Reviews , 183 Followers",9/9/2018 15:44,3,
