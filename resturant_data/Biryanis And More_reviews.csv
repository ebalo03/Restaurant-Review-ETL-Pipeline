Biryanis And More,Debjit Hazra,"The biryani here I found very delicious but needs more improvement in taste. All spices were blended and mixed well, but one thing they used a lot of spices that could probably disturb the taste",3,"6 Reviews , 3 Followers",4/29/2019 16:52,0,
Biryanis And More,Gopal Bhargav,"Me and my colleagues keep visiting this place every friday as it is very near to the office space. No much ambiance, simple restaurant. Booking is preferred on Friday's as it gets too much crowdy after 1pm. Staff isnt courteous at all. They always keep a sad face dont know why. Hopefully they are given some training to smile. Biryani taste is amazing. As I am vegetarian, i usually take Andhra Veg Biryani, Avakaya Biryani or Kaju Biryani. All of them are perfectly made. So all the rating is for only the taste, not for service and ambiance at all.",4,"47 Reviews , 320 Followers",4/27/2019 19:37,0,
Biryanis And More,Rajeev Jakkani R,"Been here twice. We have ordered Biryani‚Äôs. There were different varieties of biryanis served here. However, the taste was quite average. Since the name of the restaurant itself contains ‚ÄúBiryani‚Äù that too in City of Hyderabad the expectations were high. Being a lover of Biryani and comparing with other local Biryani Restaurants it missed that magic.
The portion of food served was also less.",3,"5 Reviews , 18 Followers",4/21/2019 16:55,0,
Biryanis And More,Raghavendra,"I have been ordering from this place for quite some time now. I have tried various types of veg biryanis available. My personal favourites are veg biryani, capsicum and mushroom biryani, mixed veg biryani.
Recently i ordered paneer tikka biryani which was really bad and i advice you to avoid ordering it.
Overall it's a good place to try out different kinds of biryanis",4,"4 Reviews , 1 Follower",4/18/2019 15:59,0,

Biryanis And More,Vishu Varanasi,"Having heard a lot about this place (specially their Triveni biryani) I came here once and ordered food 3-4 times)

The last time I purchased food here would actually be the last time I would eat from here.

This restaurant is a classic example of how it started on a grand note and ended up being just another restaurant with hygiene issues.

To cut the long chase short, I had purchased 2 items. 1 paneer tikka biryani and Bhimwaram pulav (take aways)

In spite of telling them, both items were very spicy. My wife and I were struggling with the food. Now to top it, I found a flying insect (not a cockroach but something else with wings) that got cooked with the paneer tikka biryani.

Alas, that was so repulsive that I left the food mid way and satiated my hunger with curd rice

I'm never going back to them",1,"14 Reviews , 155 Followers",3/24/2019 11:35,0,

Biryanis And More,Moonis Ahmed,"I cant fully comment or give a full 5 star rating but I would definitely start with a 4 star as the kebabs I ordered were simply one of the best I have ever had. 

I ordered Chicken Malai kebab and Chicken Hara Mirchi kebab. Both the kebabs were juicy and succulent with individual distinct flavors in each of them. I really like it when one kebab doesnt taste like the other and each has its own unique flavor. While the homeminister like the less spicy and creamy flavor of the chicken malai kebab, I preferred the tangyness of the hara mirchi kebab.

Although a bit on the pricier side, given the flavors and the taste, I am definitely waiting for a chance to order their biryani because if the kebabs are to go by anything, the biryani would definitely be flavorsome.

Biryanis And More,Sindu Sid,"' Biryani' the popular dish in Hyderabad, and yeah the most known dish throughout India.
Biryani's and more is one such place, where wide spread of biryani's are available. It has few outlet in Hyderabad, i visited to gachibowli outlet. It is located near biodiversity , beside care hospital gachibowli. This place is easily accessible, as it on main road. Its in ground floor of the building. Particular i wanted to this place, to taste some Biryani's, i have been here for dinner with group of friends.
Soon i went in, i was greeted by the friendly staff, and incredible aroma of biryani's from other diner's . We managed to snag our table.

Being settled down, we ordered few Mocktails
Mango lassi, as this is season of mango's‚ù§Ô∏è , ginger lemon, ginger cola, lemon soda, sparkling blue. Each of the Mocktails looked picturesque.

Mango lassi and lemon soda were best out of all. Rest other Mocktails were good.

To start with dinner, we had soupsüëáüèª
Lemon coriander : this is a clear soup, along with some broccoli, carrot. Veggies gave us a delicious taste and it's a healthy soup to start with.
Chicken machow soup: fried noodles were added on top od chicken soup.

Appetizers:
We have order crispy veg, corn 65, apolo fish, tender chicken, bangla kodi, chilli prawns

Crispy veg: all vegetable (onions, potato, carrot) were deep fried.
It tasted average.
It can be better.

Corn 65: corn kernels were mixed with floor , and some ingredients, corn kernels are made in to balls and than deep fried, served with mayo.

Tender chicken, prawns are must try here.

Main course : avakya chicken biryani, afghani Biryani's , veg noodles

Veg noodles: vegetable in it makes the noodle to give crunchy texture, sauces gives us a distinctive flavour. Noodles were soft, somehow i liked the noodles here.
Afghani chicken biryani: it is one exclusive Biryani here, on top of biryani' they serve omlet.

We have ordered some Indian bread, with tomato Cashew, and chicken curry.
Tomato curry with Cashew was best one i had , so in Hyderabad.

One cannot end dinner without desserts:
We have ordered junnu, jamun, kurbani ka meeta. I liked the jamun here, it was soft and tasted yummy.
I had a bad experience with junnu , everyone has a off night now and again, may b on that day junnu was bad.",4,"36 Reviews , 87 Followers",3/9/2019 12:23,9,
Biryanis And More,Tummyful_hyd,"Just the name of Biryani and Hyderabadis get hunger pangs! And so did we when we heard about Biryanis and more at Gachibowli for a food tasting session! Biryanis and more is a popular name in the food industry with its branches in USA as well, they are trying to spread the love for biryani across the globe with their lipsmacking varieties of biryani! And after a a few outlets in Hyderabad the newest was opened in Gachibowli opposite to Nissan Showroom or opposite to Biodiversity complex! The place is very easy to locate! Though a small outlet but yet incredible! Simple interiors with the place efficiently used for the seating! The staff was really friendly and attentive and a special mention to a staff member Sudhir who took good care of us right from the moment we entered to the time we left! ‚úåüèª We being completely unaware of the menu thought that this place would be just about Biryanis...but to Our surprise this place serves variety of other dishes which are really appetizing! We started off with the shakes, we were served the Mango Lassi, Ginger cola, Ginger lemon, Sparkling blue and Virgin Mojito! And all of them were soo refreshing specially the sparkling blue and the ginger cola! üëåüèª Next we had the soups, we were served the lemon coriander soup and the chicken manchow soup! They were good! And next came the starters and we had the Apollo fish, Chilli prawns, Tender chicken, Bangla Kodi, Corn 65, and Crispy veg! The best and the must have dish among them was the TENDER CHICKEN! The chicken pieces were really fleshy and juicy which were well marinated and fried with breadcrumbs! It was both Tender and crispy at the same time! Really enjoyed this dish! And the Bangla Kodi, a dish which was very new to us! It was something very unique tasty and spicy! It is made with baked potatoes with chicken filling and then it is deeply fried! You definitely should try this if you haven't! Crispy veg made with the flour batter mixed with different veggies like onion carrots etc tasted yumm! And corn 65 was amazing! Soo delectable and tasty and a completely different kind of experience for a person who have always had chicken 65! üòÇThe sea food was a little here and there.. Prawns were a little salty and the fish wasn't cooked really well...soo there's a room for improvement when it comes to the sea food! But they have covered it all up with their DELICIOUS BIRYANIS!üòç A complete delight to your eyes and to your taste buds as well! We had the Ulavacharu Chicken Biryani, Chicken Avakai Biryani and Chicken Afghani Biryani! Totally totally worth the money and just the Best ‚ù§ Ulavacharu biryani made of the spices from Horse gram has that khatta meetha taste in it making it soo soo damn awesome! It is said that Ulavacharu gives heat to your body soo don't forget to have some curd, yoghurt or the raita to make it even! And then there was this Chicken Avakai Biryani, yet another mindblowing taste! Avakai means Mango..and this Biryani is made from the spices of Mango...it had the taste of the mango pickle! Never had we imagined that we'd ever be eating chicken biryani with the taste of Mango pickle! üòçüòç Then came the Afghani biryani...it's just the opposite of Ulavacharu and Avakai when it comes to the spicy level! Really flavourful and palatable biryani served with an omelette on top! Believe us if you're a Biryani lover then this place should be definitely be in Your list! I'm gonna go back again for the Biryani! ‚ù§ the other main course included Naan basket with Chicken tikka masala and Chicken chettinadu! As you must be knowing Chicken Chettinadu a popular dish from Tamil Nadu is a very spicy dish and yet very tasty! And here at biryanis and more they have kept up with that level of spicy-ness and also the Taste! Soo the main course here is the real stunner! Next we had the desserts...ever wished to be Ganesh Gaitonde? üòÇ You definitely do not want that life! But yes You can enjoy the same dessert which he just LOVES! The Kharvas also called as Junnu is an Indian milk pudding and it is made from the colostrum of the cow! We don't know how the actual taste of the Junnu is as we never had it before but yes here at biryanis and more the taste was Superb! üòç You ought to have this dessert to get that Gaitonde feels! Next in line were the Gulab Jamun and Qubani ka meetha, the presentation of the desserts isn't really appealing soo the hotel management should definitely look after that and make some changes but the taste was good! üëçüèª
Soo if You love to enjoy a variety in Biryani then Biryanis and more should be Your next stop! üòç You're going to love it",4,"18 Reviews , 271 Followers",3/8/2019 2:04,9,

The lovely place is properly situated at the prominent cross roads of Biodiversity, Gachibowli, right opposite to Nissan showroom. The place and its ambiance is quite cozy as the lighting is subtle and ambient which blends in pretty well with the interiors of the restaurant. The staff is exceptionally attentive and a special shout out to Mr. Sudhir for completely taking care us and treating us with an excellent dinner.

As soon as we sat down, we were greeted enthusiastically with mocktails. A group of six food enthusiasts promptly ordered six diverse mocktails namely Sparking blue, Mango lassi, Ginger cola, Ginger lemons, Virgin mojito, Masala cola. Out of all the mocktails, Masala cola and mango Lassi stood out and were the best. The other mocktails were equally good and refreshing.

Delicious appetizers:

Crispy Veg: A variety of vegetables deep fried and garnished with aromatic flavors was something that wasn‚Äôt new that we didn't have, but it tasted excellent!

Corn 65: It tasted absolutely delicious. Corn balls deep fried and then garnished with mayo to give the 65 feel! Thoroughly recommended.

Bangla Kodi: Which was a signature dish of the restaurant, but for us it was a dish that also stood apart.

Chilli prawns: Spicy, stirred fried, It tasted awesome.

Tender chicken: The star of the appetizers. Brest chicken fillets dipped and fried with bread crumb batter. Highly recommended, please don't miss out on this dish.

Apollo fish: So it was a fish. Apart from that about the taste was okays‚Äôish.

Main Course:

Chettinad Chicken: Very Spicy and it went absolutely well with the butter naan.

Kolhapuri Chicken: Mild flavours, the taste was good!

Uluvacharu Chicken Biryani: This was the highlight of the dinner, unique taste and flavors, the restaurant lived up to the name of Biryani, Highly Recommended.

Avakai Chicken biryani: A novel kind of taste for me and I really liked it.

Afghani chicken Biryani: Mild flavor biryani topped with Egg-omelet, It tasted really good.

Desserts:

Qubani ka meetha, Junnu and Gulab Jamun were served to us and we were extremely dissatisfied with the desserts. I earnestly request the effective management to please look into the dessert part. Everything else made it a great evening to hang out with family and friends for good Indian biryani Flavours.

Biryani and more, a new outlet in Gachibowli is fine-dine restaurant.
It has recently opened and serves varieties of biryani and other food dishes.
This restaurant is on the ground floor and can be easily spotted by the crowd passing by the road.
I‚Äôve been here for a dinner session.
The ambience of this place is quite good with bright lights all over the place.
It was a weekend and there was a pretty good amount of crowd at that time.
We started with mocktails.
They had many varieties of mocktails,out which we ordered the sparkling blue,ginger cola,mango lassi,ginger lemon and ginger mojito.
All the mocktails were of different colours making them very appealing for us to drink.
Almost all the mocktails had mint,lemon and ice which was refreshing!
The mango lassi was too sweet.
Then we were served with soups,
Veg lemon coriander soup
Chicken manchow soup
The veg lemon coriander soup was served hot with parboiled broccoli.
The chicken manchow soup was full of flavour and was served with crispy fried noodles,it tasted delicious.
We were then served with starters,
Apollo fish:
The fish was well cooked and soft but had so much of salt in it.
Tender chicken:
This was something very tasty,the chicken was soft,tender and with good amount of spice.
Bangla kodi:
It is one of the most popular dishes,it was crispy,light and was well presented with coriander garnish.
The chilli prawns:
The prawns were juicy,spicy and had great flavour.
Crispy veg and corn 65 were other vegetarian starters which we had.
They also were good but not that great.
Next we were served with main course:
They served us different types of curry‚Äôs with Indian breads.
The chicken chetinadu,its a spicy chicken curry which was too good.
The other curry‚Äôs were chicken tikka masala,tomato cashew nut and ulvacharu chicken.
The ulvacharu chicken,a chicken curry with horse gram soup was outstanding and finger licking good.

Biryanis:
We were then served biryani.
avakai chicken biryani
Afghani chicken biryani

Avakai chicken biryani is a authentic Andhra dish,it had a wonderful taste still haunting.
Afghani chicken biryani is very different from other biryani,it had unique flavour.
It was served with egg omelet above the biryani .
We ended up our meal with deserts,
Qubani ka meetha,gulab jamun and junnu.
The deserts were not that great and had disappointed me.
Overall the restaurant has good biryani‚Äôs and I would suggest everyone to visit this place especially for avakai chicken biryani.

Biryanis And More,Kulsum Begum,"I ordered my lunch from this place and it was really disappointing experience for me. I had ordered garlic naan, chicken patiala, pepper chicken and chicken majestic.
Garlic naan was somewhat ok. But, chicken patiala was not at all as expected, it was somewhat sweet and with a different color and the taste was also not good.
Pepper chicken was over fried, which was giving a burnt taste.
Chicken majestic was also not that good. Thin strips of chicken being served which serves any justification to the name itself, neither by it's taste nor appearance.
My personal experience with Biryanis and more was not at all good.",2,"41 Reviews , 67 Followers",8/25/2018 1:58,0,
Biryanis And More,Gaurav Gupta (GG),"Restaurant must be preserving the old veggies. I ordered Veg Paneer Babycorn biryani. Babycorn was rotten completely, I felt pathetic after eating.

Items are in menu card only not in kitchen. What ever I have asked server saying not Available sir. Almost 5 items he said not there even some of them are from there special once.
So finally I have asked him to get what ever is there in the kitchen.
The disappointed lunch at biryans.

We had to wait more than 30 minutes for the food to be served, that too when we asked then they served. The staff was rude as well. Had to ask for every little thing.

Biryanis And More,Sajid Hussain,"Been there for a team lunch.. Ordered Ulvacharu mutton biryani, Chicken pulao and Bamboo chicken
Ulvacharu mutton biryani (5stars) was the winner.. everyone in the team absolutely loved it.
Bamboo chicken (3 Stars) Although it was cooked in a Bamboo, it wasn't hot and the bamboo looked like it was already used earlier.. after complaining to the manager they served it again and then it was hot and nice.
Chicken pulao was good.
Staff is very polite!
Over all a good experience! Definitely 3.5 Stars and above",4,3 Reviews,7/19/2018 0:14,0,

Biryanis And More,Rabia Sultana,"I visited the place with my colleagues. We were around 15 people. Though the ambience was good, and food tasted okay, it‚Äôs not worth the money. The real problem is that the place is quite congested in the first place. You will have to go quite early to avoid wait time. But that didn‚Äôt help us either. I was extremely disappointed with the service. We waited for almost like 1 hour for the food to arrive. By the time the veg food arrived (add on is that the soup came after starters were brought), our non-veg friends were having the main-course. The staff was not apologetic at all.

I would not prefer to have food here again.

Plus, you will find hell lot of flies around. All the time I was waving over my food üòï",2,"10 Reviews , 2 Followers",7/16/2018 21:57,0,
