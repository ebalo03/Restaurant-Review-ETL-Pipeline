Al Saba Restaurant,Arza Naveen,"Visited this place at night. Had chicken Biryani, Fish Biryani, tandoori chicken as starter. Food taste wise was good. we choose In door A/C seating. Need to work on cleanliness which is lacking in this place.",3,"19 Reviews , 20 Followers",5/17/2019 15:32,0,
Al Saba Restaurant,Srujin Rajan,"Yet another Sunday evening.. It was quite late when I reached this place.. But it was not the time to shut down the restaurant as well.. It was shocking to see no one in the restaurant though..

Ambience was normal and there is nothing to hype about it.. The hotel is not kept clean.. Infact there was an insect in the plate that was given to my first and I had to change my plate eventually.. Service was pretty late considering the items that we ordered..

I ordered chicken majestic and egg biryani .. To be frank, the food was disastrous... U can't put the blame on the time i went as well because it was at 10 in the night.. The starter looked like gravy and tasted very and the briyani had no masala at all..

Starter : chicken majestic
Rice and biryanis : egg biryani

Ambience : 2
Food : 1

Al Saba Restaurant,Hari Prasad Thangavelu,"Have been to this restaurant many times. Taste wise, preferably better than all other restaurants (next to Shah Ghouse, I would say). Quantity wise, one biriyani will be more than enough. Chicken Biriyani with double masala would be a treat to taste buds. Go for it. The chicken would be damn soft and good. Starters like Pepper Chicken, Chicken Tikka, Tandoori, all are good. They need to work more on ambiance as the place is not clean.

There are numerous places across city for dum biryani and this is one of thr best. Although the spices used and cooking process is same, every biryani in different in its flavour.
This is a pocket friendly place available late night.
Both Chicken and Mutton biryani are good and they also serve fish biryani here which is also a must try dish. Kebabs are also very good here.
Coming to ambience, its a huge place with chai cafe kind of ambiance but they also have AC hall for family section.
Service is the only terrible thing here. Even during the peek lunch time, they say biryani is over and fresh hundi is awaited, which is terrible.
I mostly do take away here which is a better option.

Al Saba Restaurant,The Greedy Hippo,"The classic example of what happens when all aspects of a restaurant are not taken care of. When your service doesnt compliment the food one serves, it sometimes leads to disaster. Walked in on early lunch and had a tough time asking the waiters to temp down the ac for they have been keeping it at 17 degrees. Agreed the influx of customers at lunch demands that but the early birds shouldnt have to suffer because of that. 

Ordered a variety of dishes only to find out fish is not available. The service time was also too much. I found the waiters to be a little rude. I can sense their awkwardness in serving to an Odia table themselves being odia. 
Neways now coming on to the food. The chicken biriyani does taste good as far as Hyderabadi Biriyani is considered. Other items such as mutton biriyani , paneer masala and dal were also good.

Its a one time visit restaurant but if the restaurant has to give a tough time to counterparts in Gachibowli, it has a long way to go.
