Shanghai Chef 2,Anupam Acharya,"We went to the first floor confused whether to go to Shanghai Chef or Kobe's, later to realise they are in the same restaurant (i.e they share floor space). We decided to order Chinese. We had the DimSum platter (3/5), Kung Pao Chicken (2/5), Dragon Prawns (2/5) and Fried Ice Cream (4/5). The chicken was hard inside (not indicative of fresh chicken), the prawns were sweet and the DimSums had thick coatings. I did not enjoy my time at Shanghai Chef. So maybe when you're there, just try the Sizzler. Ill update my review when I have it.
Kobe's is a really famous chain for Sizzlers.",2,"207 Reviews , 400 Followers",5/17/2019 12:18,2,
Shanghai Chef 2,Abhijeet Mahapatro,"They have a wide range of food offering. Nothing much to talk about ambiance. I visited this place 2 times in a week. 1st time ordered a sizzler which was fantastic.  2nd time we had a chicken stater, soup and a american chopsuey. Soup and starter was good but sea food American Chopsuey was not good. Being a person from coastal area I can tell if sea food is fresh or not, and boy, the prawns were not fresh that is for sure. All and all its a causal dinning if you crave for some variety of Asian food.",4,"9 Reviews , 14 Followers",5/14/2019 12:25,0,

We have visited it in past and have always loved the food.

This time we tried some nice salt and pepper vegetable starter which was okish..as I found it to be a little bland..( that's why there is one less star).

We tried Veg Manchow soup which was amazing.

Khao Soi was the main dish we ordered and was again bang on.

Ambiance is pretty much simple yet nice.

Shanghai Chef 2,Singh Rahul,"The Overall Rating present for this restaurant doesn't justice the experience (will come to this in a bit)

So, a small almost cute little place tucked in first floor with ambient lightings turned on (to give romantic dinner table feel) and apt audible english chartbusters couldn't go any wrong with setup and restaurant proudly own this.
With this as a beginning, shanghai chef takes the dinning experience to whole new diff level which is confusing at its best. Waiters are surely not in the mood to offer appropriate tables to guests, not aware of all the food which is getting prepared in kitchen, not aware of all the 'Must Try' dishes of their own menu & most of all courtesy seems to have been left at the mercy of the servers. Like an example, since its not a fine dining we can't expect servers to serve your food left in the bowl again but same server at one table doing the same thing neglecting other tables left too much to be desired. This was the case, when a cockroach was found in one of the guests food and staff tried to avoid the scene blaming it to fate.
On the food side, crispy corn was good but avoid maonchow soup. Flat noodles also served just warm that too after enquiring multiple times.Also, Service takes the beating even if just half tables are filled.

So, coming back to first line. The rating is probably for food only, go at your own risk if your are looking for experience !",2,"24 Reviews , 409 Followers",12/8/2018 15:09,1,

I've tried the tei pei chicken starter and it was not great, the starter was not skinless and also the chicken was very chewy making it difficult to swallow.

Shanghai Chef 2,M.Y.,"I have never rated a place one star before but this place dissapointed me to the core!
Ambience is pretty decent and so is the pricing, but the food is nowhere close to being authentic chinese ,oriental or any of the cuisines they are serving. Food was so spicy that we were sipping water after every bite and after few bites i had started tearing up. It was so spicy full of whole red chillies that it was impossible to eat it (P.S. we are a family who loves spicy food). Also in the name of dimsum for rupees 250 they served street style steamed veggie momos which cost barely 50 rupees a plate. Highly dissapointed with food!!",1,"8 Reviews , 4 Followers",10/26/2018 21:48,1,
Shanghai Chef 2,Jayagopal Nair,It's our default choice when we crave Chinese food and if we are around the Gachibowli area.

Shanghai Chef 2,The Greedy Hippo,"I had high expectations of this restaurant but was dissapointed. I sometimes ponder to visit them again, because as per user reviews they are good.

The seating is well, the air conditioning is not. Its either chilly or completely stopped. You cant help it.

The servers are less and even being a small place, you have to shout to catch their attention.

The food. Oh God! I dont know what happened with the chef that day, but he had put spinach in all of my dishes and that too in huge quantities. They were wreaking havoc on the plate and we had to leave a dish totally for that matter.

So many wrongs, bounds me to visit them once again to see whether they are like this all the time or was I unfortunate to visit them on their bad day. They also need a experienced manager.

Shanghai Chef 2,Krishna Kant Chaubey,"Went to this place which a bunch of foodies for a review session and to my delight it turned out to be an awesome experience.
I always wanted to visit authentic chineese restaurants and this was the one.
The service was very good along with a perfect ambience.
Lets begin with the food part:
We started with a couple of soups Tom Kha Gai (which was a coconut milk based chicken soup and it was very yummy as you can feel the coconut flavour) followed by lemon corriander soup which was also good.
Amongst the starters we tried Tei Pei Chicken,Kung pao Chicken, Phuket fish( this was one of the best as the fish was perfectly fried and it was also crispy), Drawn prawns (nice crispy which nice sausage).
Now the best part was the Shu mai, the dumplings were great and delicious it was my first time though but i found it really great.
In the main course we had Phad Thai Phak(spicy flavored rice with nice flavours and the aroma was too temptingüòã),Burmese Khow Suey which were steamed noodles with several add-ons like peanuts, fried onions etc. (a must try one if you visit this place).
We also had some mocktails my personal favorite was Fall in love along with a couple of other like fruit punch .....
The last but not the least the desert part we had fried ice-creams which had coconut base and it was very yummy üòã.
A nice place to visit if you are looking for some authentic chineese dishes.",5,"27 Reviews , 294 Followers",8/27/2018 12:53,14,
Shanghai Chef 2,Nikitha Rao,"Recently I went to this place for a review session with bunch of freaks. This place is located at indiranagar.
Service was really great .

When it come to chineese cuisine , I thought to order few authentic dishes .

Firstly they served us with soup : chicken manchow soup and tom kha gai/gung which is coconut based. People who likes coconut based cuisine then they must try this.
Coming to starters we ordered tai Pai chicken, dragon prawns, Kung Pao, Phuket fish, dumplings named shu mai. Out of these best was Phuket fish which was crispy frm outside .

Main course: They served us Burmese know suey , again this is coconut based dish where the gravy is made out of coconut . It's served with plain noodles , add ons like peanuts, fried onions , green chillies, variety of suaces .
Pad Thai rice which was just like fried rice .

They also serve mocktails and desert.
Fried ice cream was the best.",5,"49 Reviews , 192 Followers",8/27/2018 12:17,6,
Shanghai Chef 2,Abhishek Gupta,"I had visited few among many Chinese places in past. Recently got a chance to visit Shaghai Chef, located at prime location, Indra Nagar. Welcomed nicely by the staff members.

I didn't thought much about food in starting, as people don't eat Chinese daily and I am weak in remembering Chinese dishes name, I had one thing in my mind, Shezwan :P. But as soon as the dinner started, I was surprised, there is more to it, started with Tom kha gai/gung - Chicken Soup, Coconut based soup, creamy and smooth, with spices and topped with red chilli, one word, fantabulous. Then the marathon started, one after another I was enjoying every bite, had few expression changes in between but at end, the conclusion - amazing dinner.

Strated with starter, Tai pai chicken, Dragon prawns... Pakoda kind, tossed to give a spicy flavour, I am not a fan of prawns, so can't say, Kung puo chicken... Was decent, Phuket fish... basha fish, kind of crispy from outside, soft inside, tasted amazing, and the dumplings, named Shu mai, open dumplings with minced chicken, it's not spices but is simply wow, go for it. Tried few mocktails, was ok but need some improvement, other than that everything was good. And then the deserts, ice cream on brownie and fried ice cream were something hatke, must try.

In main course we had, Burmese khow suey... Noodles mixed with coconut kind gravy, not spicy with stuffs to add on, liked fried peanut, fried onions, chillis, diff sauces etc. and Phad thai Rice, both were also good. Overall had a good time and dinner, the staff members made our food tasting visit more comfortable. Recommended for good dine in, one can go with dishes with must try tag, if unable to decide and can consult staff members for know about the dishes.",4,"74 Reviews , 1177 Followers",8/27/2018 2:35,8,
Shanghai Chef 2,Nelu J,"This restaurant have got a very peaceful atmosphere so been to this place for dinner with friends.We ordered soups 1st were my favourite was Toma Gai/Gung which is a rich coconut milk based prawns Thai soup.We can taste the thick coconut milk taste and being a malayalee I always love the coconut taste and I just loved this one.It is a mild soup which give a small sweetness of coconut milk.Other two soups we ordered were manchow soup and Chicken lemon coriander soup.Manchow soup dint taste like how it is suppose to be.We ordered the chicken one so it was a spicy soup with a chilly and garlic combo and coming to the chicken lemon coriander soup,it had a strong taste of lemon with minced chicken and vegetables and I dint like that much but my friend who ordered this soup loved this.

Now coming to the starters,we ordered Dragon prawns,Tei pei chicken,Kung puo chicken,Shu mai dumplings,Phuket fish.We were served with dragon prawns first which was crispy added into a sauce and garnished with cashew nuts kinda dish which is spicy.Tei Pei dish was a starter which I loved than the dragon prawns one,which is mildy sweet one and not too spicy like dragon prawns.So the last starter we tried was Phuket fish which was cooked well and it was fried kinda hard and added to soya sauce and tasted awesome.Coming to djmoljngs we had Shu mai dumplings which are steamed and half opened dumplings which was tasting too good with the chilly sauce.

We ordered mocktails after the starter and we had Fall in Love which I really loved which had a mixed taste of both litchi and strawberry,Litchi Punch which I ordered which doesn't give the colour of litchi and dint give too much of litchi taste,alfonza which is of mango and tasted great and also fruit punch which was a mixed fruit mocktail.They have mentioned mocktail with scoop of ice cream so I dint find a scoop in it or don't know whether they mix it with the juice and serve but all were tasting great.

Now coming to the main course we had Burmese khow suey and Phad Thai phak.We had the Burmese dish which was ma favourite again as it is made of rich coconut milk and noodles one and too yummy for your tummy dish.This dish was served with other set of seasonings and condiments so people do try this one and you will love this and this is creamy non-spicy dish.Phad Thai Phak which was of rice type garnished with an egg omelette which is like a fried rice dish and a spicy one.

Last we had fried ice cream and brownie with ice-cream as desserts.Both were yummy where brownie ice cream was served with butterscotch ice cream flavour with a strawberry sauce as the topping and fried ice-cream coating is made of coconut so do try these.",4,"49 Reviews , 390 Followers",8/26/2018 10:15,14,

Shanghai Chef 2,Ankit Jain,"Nothing could be better than having restaurant owner recieving you at entrance and assuring you of best service.
The restuarant is located on first floor ,having sufficiently spacious area with decent interiors -appropriately giving a glimpse of typical Chinese restaurant .Not to mention the love of colour red and yellow which found prominence here too ! I hereby got convinced to rate ambience and decor (4/5)

The crew was humble and the owner seemed delighted to have us .After exchanging a few words ,he suggested us the best and quick food we could grab .
Owner and staff courtesy (5/5)

We first ordered talumein soup(3.5/5)-moderately spicy and filled with veggies ,which is certainly a healthy start

We ordered mee gorang noodles (3.5/5) - comprised of lots of green and red chillies .a perfect form of noodles to relish .
Recommended to those who are tired of shewzwan noodles

Noodles accompanied with 8 hot pot garlic gravy(3/5) which Went with noodles so well except the excessive quantity of French beans that hindered the potential of dish.",3,"138 Reviews , 821 Followers",8/4/2018 16:01,4,
Shanghai Chef 2,AbstractFoodie,Food was okay. We ordered two chicken dishes for starters and it had too much sauce in it. Noodles were good. Monis were really good though. Would try again rest was okay. Would try again if no options are available. :/,3,"76 Reviews , 113 Followers",8/2/2018 5:05,0,
Shanghai Chef 2,Rahul Agarwal,"Ok place. The food was just fine, but since it is reasonably priced, its decent value for money.
Service is ordinary though.
On a sunday afternoon, the place was empty and it was hard to digest. I almost went out but then decided to give it a try anyway.
Bottom line, if i want to eat relatively inexpensive Chinese food, then this might be a choice, else no.",3,"34 Reviews , 233 Followers",7/31/2018 11:01,0,

Shanghai Chef 2,Rita Singh,"What a scrumptious dinner at Shanghai chef 2.

After a long day at chilkur Balaji we we're so hungry that we just wanted to check-in to some restaurant where we will get food like the moment we enter. However, good food was also a priority to us, also being rainy season street food is a little matter of concern for hygiene.

The first thing that came into my mind when we touched gachibowli was sanghai chef.We did not take a second thought and went straight into the restaurant.

The restaurant has very cozy ambiance with simple decor, comfortable seating and dim lighting. So neat and clean that it was hard to believe when suhail Bhai told us that it's a 10 years old restaurant and his first one.

Aditya came to our rescue and we just told him ki bro get whatever is best you feel, he suggested us all the dishes throughout.

We started off with TOM KHA GHAI SOUP : Actually this was a great choice being succha cold weather outside and we being so tired. The garlic and bamboo stick flavours could actually help our bad throat and the coconut flavoured soup with loads of fresh veggies and big chunks of chiken we're so refreshing.

We then ordered NASI GORENG CHIKEN :Long grains of perfectly cooked rice with loads and loads of flavours in it. **Must try** and BAR B Q CHIKEN : this was perfect combination with the rice, lil sweet, spicy and flavoursome chiken cooked semi wet.**Must try**

Mix sea food soft noodles and mix sea food rice were amazing too.

Burmese khow sue was one amazing dish too ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

For take away we ordered PHAD THAI MIX SEA FOOD NOODLES.....and trust me after having so much at restaurant, I couldn't resist when Rawshan opened the box at home. I went ahead and gulped down four spoons of it. Oh my god, this is one AmaZing dish that I have tasted in recent times and if tell you about quantity, one take away of this is sufficient for three people.

Flat noodles cooked with garlic, fresh herbs, prawns and fish, with mushroom and sweet sauce. Also fresh red chilli. *** A must must try ****

Quantity of food served here is unbelievable.

For the taste and quantity and quality the VFM factor is best in the town.

Bill came to 1600+ for 4 after 10% friendly gesture discount.

Staff is very friendly and Aditya was great at service.

We were about to leave Suhail SuhRac MacAdams bumped into us. It was great meeting you. And thanks for making our dinner so special.",5,"106 Reviews , 1893 Followers",7/15/2018 12:48,10,
Shanghai Chef 2,Mr. Mighty,"An awesome place to enjoy Chinese. It looks very ordinary from the outside but the interior of the restaurant is very classy. The ambience is really very good. The most amazing and surprising part of this restaurant is it's food. I was so amazed with the food. It's a 100% must go place for all foodies. The prices matches the quantity+quality and doesn't leave a hole in your pocket. This sets the restaurant miles apart in comparison to other similar level Chinese restaurant.
This restaurant will definitely be one of my top favourites while considering Chinese.",5,"22 Reviews , 32 Followers",7/14/2018 15:17,2,
