Mohammedia Shawarma,Koolaid Pickle.,"These guys used to be really good at making delicious falafel and regular shawarma. Over the time, the quality seems to have dropped to an extent that the food smells bad and makes you feel sick.

The wrapping paper which they use to wrap these things in, sometimes sticks to your food. If I were you, I wouldn't eat here. Save your money and skip this place!",1,"12 Reviews , 5 Followers",3/5/2019 12:51,0,

Mohammedia Shawarma,Imran,"Unprofessional and unhygienic. Shawarma fast food shops have sprang up in every nook and corner of the city but they typically have their setup on roads. Hygiene is never considered.

Mohammedia Shawarma,Sanchita Tripathi,"I ordered a cheese falafel wrap. The wrap had no cheese. The falafel was deep fried in oil that was quite old and I could taste it in every bite which made it quite bad. Apart from that quantity wise it was quite good, but tbh quality matters too.

Would I order again? Not really",2,"51 Reviews , 99 Followers",1/13/2019 23:27,2,

Doesn't uphold the mohammedia standard.

Mohammedia Shawarma,Vishnu Prasad,Please be advised of the tasteless crap load sold as shawarma. Filled with vegetable and nothing but tons of vegetables to make sure you won't complain.
