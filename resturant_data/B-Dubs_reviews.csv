B-Dubs,Srishti Dubey,"The best place to be if you want to see some sport screening.
What I really liked about the place is they have round about 42 screens and no matter where you sit you will have 5-6 screens which will be clearly visible.
No fight or waiting to get place near to the screen.

We went here during IPL screening.
It was really a great experience.

What we had ordered was ultimate nachos,chicken wings with Chipotle sauce and pizza.

Everything was really delicious.

Portion were quite good for two.

I feel it's bit over priced but worth it..!!

Service is excellent,staff is very warm and friendly.

B-Dubs,Pratipurna Panda,"Sooo... It's a sports bar. On the side of a busy road , so easily accessible. Very lit... Bright.. a bit too bright for my taste though.
I went on a special day , so there was a live music band playing. But it was too loud. So the brightness and the loud music didn't do justice to so much as setting the mood.

Food was ok, taste wise. But price was on the higher side. Limited variety of food. But they have done some nice experiments with the wings. So , try worthy.

But there are very nice people working there. Very friendly, Nice staff. Service was very good.

Along with that, if the ambiance would be set for proper occasion, then what a hit a road side sports bar would be..!!
