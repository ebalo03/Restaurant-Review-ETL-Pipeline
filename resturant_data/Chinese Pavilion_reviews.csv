Chinese Pavilion,Diaryofmuna,"I had ordered Manchow Soup. The taste was very nice. It felt like a great start . Crispy noodles in it added a great texture and taste to the Soup, chicken was cooked well, overall a very good subtle starter. The Chilli Chicken Dry was One of the best I've tasted,was kinda smoky, chicken was cooked very well. the prawns quality and taste were justtt totally ammazing,cooked to perfection. Only drawback was the price and quantity werent up to the mark. the Chilli Garlic Burnt Sauce tasted extremely weird. The chicken fried rice was not that great too . It had good aroma and aura but taste was average . The restaurant had good ambience. Overall it was good experience",3,"27 Reviews , 10 Followers",5/8/2019 15:02,8,
Chinese Pavilion,Himanshu Chhabra,"It is overrated casual Chinese food, with lot of oil. You can call it more of Indian Chinese. Ordered wolly chicken average. Flat noodles very oily. Thread chicken was oily. The captain/manager denied us Axis bank card discount because it was not told before. No restaurant denied me that discount before. Quantity is too much and they charged more than what was mentioned in the menu. Seriously it is an overated ""Indian Chinese"" restaurant. One star is for the thread chicken starter (oily, fried).",1,"5 Reviews , 52 Followers",5/5/2019 22:59,0,
Chinese Pavilion,Arun Prasad,"Overrated place. It's a disappointment and below par as per taste. We had panok prawns, you could taste the batter, it's basically the deep fried prawns however the taste is not at al upto the mark. Schewan noddles and chicken garlic sauce is below par. Nothing great about the place.",2,"5 Reviews , 41 Followers",4/28/2019 20:37,0,
Chinese Pavilion,Rishita Mukherjee,It's an good place to try out casual chinese dining. Must try their royal Thai prawn soup. I got captivated with the flavour of that.

Chinese Pavilion,George B.,"We love chinese food and we headed for Chinese Pavilion to have dinner on a Wednesday evening. We reached there by 7:30 and we were the first customers, by 8:30 onwards people started to fill the restaurant. It‚Äôs not difficult to find the place since is on the main road.

Ambiance is nice, the typical chinese music that goes on is kind of relaxing. Decors have chinese items so it‚Äôs not bad.

Service was spot on, we were attended very. It didn‚Äôt take much time for the food to come out from the kitchen.

For food we had Satay Chicken sticks and Spicy Black Bean Lamb for starters, Teppan Soba Noodles Sizzler for main course and cheesecake for desserts. The satay chicken was so tender that immediately fell from the skewers and melted in the mouth, really good. The Lamb was good but not wow. The noodles tasted awesome! It came sizzling, buttery and full of flavour. Usually in India is hard to find a decent cheesecake but for our surprise this one was really good so really a good culinary experience. The prices are a bit on the higher side but deserves a try definitely. Recommend!

I ordered veg man-chow soup, veg mini dragon rolls in appetiser and in main course water chestnut, baby corn, broccoli wholly sauce curry with veg fried rice.

Chinese Pavilion,Subha V,"Such good place for Chinese food...

Ambience: Nice and peaceful.

Taste: Very good. I had lemon grass soup since I had a sore throat and it helped me more than I wished for. Lemon, coriander, and chillies have all added to the flavors. The crispy water chestnut starter is sweet but tasty. I could not stop myself from finishing the sweet coriander sauce that had a hint of mint.
Teppan soba noodles, a sizzler, is just as good. All in all, a happy experience!

Will I visit again: Yes!

Cost effectiveness: Average. About 700 for a person.

We ordered a lemongrass soup, honey potato (please lookup exact names in the menu) to begin with and proceeded to have veg soft noodles and manchurian. The manchurian isn't the desi version that you get in most places so the spice levels can be a let down. But the noodles were thin and light. Overall a delicious meal.

They also provide baby chair which has become a must for me. I ordered everything veg sweet corn soup, veg mini dragon rolls and haka noodles. The sweet corn soup was good and thick and tastes delicious with all vegetables. He veg mini dragons are mini spring rolls that kind of disappointed me as they were very oily. May be it's my personal choice but I wish they are less oily. The haka noodles were the best I have had and loved them to the core.

They served us a bland soup and when we enquired about it the ""captain ""(person who took the order) said we should taste the soup first before asking.

Chinese Pavilion,Siva ** EPICURE**,"We have been here on weekend afternoon for lunch as we want to have a authentic Chinese. Nice ambience, less crowded & peaceful environment. Warmly welcomed by staff. Coming to food as we have kid with us, so the dishes we ordered were of less Spice. Ordered some Veg soup, couple of starters. I must say Veg soup was made to perfection, full marks. We didn't like starters; Honey potato was too much on sweeter side than it should be & Babycorn starter has no taste (No salt, No spice). But again Main course specially Egg fried rice was very nice & tasty (could have ordered a bit more spicy one; bcoz it was infromed to us when ordering about the spice level but we ignored, so no complaints). Over all good experience, but spicy levels are far less :)

Chinese Pavilion,Aditya Kumar,"Visited this place on a friday evening. Saw good rating on Zomato and decided to give this place a try.
This place has great ambience and decent staff. We ordered veg soup and chicken manchow soup they were good. But if you see the attached image to this review, the cucumber and salad, which i got was not fresh and this had disappointed me. You would expect fresh food on your table, when you pay premium price.
We then ordered garlic based noodles (cant remember the name), mongolian chicken and lime soda. The food was great but again, we found the mushrooms in the noodles not fresh and this made me quiet disappointed.
Overall i would say the food was great, a bit pricey though. I could not give a great rating because of the things mentioned above.",2,"12 Reviews , 2 Followers",11/25/2018 20:38,2,

Ordered wanton soup and chicken dimsum.
For a crazy dimsum lover , the dish was unappealing as the outer cover was thick , though the chicken portions were decent . The wanton soup was mediocre.
What bothered me was the service personnel hurried his way through the order and mentioned that only main course can be served. It was still 15 minutes for the closing time.

We ordered:

Stuffed Mushrooms: They were a little too sweet, yet they tasted great. And quantity was great.

Mushroom in Shechuan Sauce: We ordered this dish, but they sent us some fried paneer gravy dish, we opened it very late after we recieved the order, so we decided to go with it and the paneer  tasted like they used frozen paneer, or may be it was tofu, I have never tasted tofu before so I can't say. But we didn't really like it.

Hakka Noodles: Noodles tasted great. Really tasty, and quantity was really good.

Fresh lime soda: It was really good and refreshing.

Fried rice: It was decent with good amount of veggies. Quality of rice was good.

Stir fried greens: It was really very tasty, good amount of different veggies like Broccoli, Pringle etc

Every dish I liked. Jade chicken soup was something new for me & having spinach in I was wondering how it would taste. But to my surprise in was too good.Terriyaki chicken was excellent. chicken fried rice was something that I dint like much but Haka noodles was a good one.

Vegetables - Baby corn, Brocolli appeared stale and they got a WIERD mushroom, which was yuckyyy to the core. I eat mushroom and like it but this was something terrible.

Quick feet,friendly and humble staff make your visit a memorable one.
We ordered:
Jade Soup:This could seem a lil bland according to many.But for me spinach broth with sliced garlic was packed with oriental touch.For a change shredded meat in Soup was not rubbery.

Sea Wars : This appetizer was blend of fried prawns,fish and squid .The chilli soy sauce and sweet coriander sauce served on side added a wonderful touch to this delightful dish.

Fook Chook Fried Rice: White sauce (not cream based) topped Fried Rice had a subtle flavor.It was loaded with vegetables.

Honey Noodles with ice cream : Texture of the Noodles here was nothing like the ones I tasted earlier.Fried Noodles had a fudgy Texture with went along real well with thick creamy ice cream.
Fruit punch was decent.But pinacolda has to be improved.
I recommend you to visit this place if you enjoy oriental cuisine sparcely infused with Indian flavors

Let me start of by complementing the service of this place- such a homely and warm feel when each waiter was more than willing to make us comfortable, the owner Mr. Ali, who himself helped us out in deciding what to order based on our pallet. The food was exactly what we wanted wait sorry let me correct myself, it was way better than what we wanted.
Our order came in around 15 min ( maybe lesser ) and it consisted of crispy lamb, noodles saut√©ed in this wonderful butter garlic combination!!, mixed fried rice and chicken in oyster sauce!! The food was exceptionally good ! Each dish was gourmet level and to top it all of we had desserts which was darsaan and ice cream ( the best darsaan I've ever had ).

Chinese Pavilion,Kaushik And Neha,"Hello, 

This place was bookmarked for a long time now so I wanted to pay it a visit. And finally the moment came when I was actually able to go there. I am a huge fan of Indo-Chinese cuisine and I honestly had a high hope from this place but all in all it was disappointment. 

I ordered chicken manchow soup which was good although the salt was on the higher side. Hakka noodles and fried rice has too much oil and there's no reason for that amount of oil to be there in the Chinese food. 

Wolly chicken and chicken chilli dry had extreme amount of garlic which weren't properly fried and rather than giving a good taste, it made the entire dish difficult to eat as the flavour was overpowering. 

All in all, the food wasn't enjoyable. 

Will I visit again? Probably not! I am sorry!

The ambience is good but the service, quality and quantity of food is amazing. We had soup which was good and as a part of starters we had ginger chicken which was really amazing.
For main course we had hakka noodles with chicken in spicy black bean sauce and mongolian chicken. I must say all of them were really amazing and had a great quantity and quality is beyond words.
Then in desert we had chocolate mousse and chocolate volcano with vanilla ice cream.
Mousse was good but the volcano was really really good.

#FoodShaukeen #ChinesePavilion

Chinese Pavilion was one place which was hiding in my wishlist for very long in Chinese category and this wish was fulfilled when a friend wanted to throw a party in a Chinese restaurant, and I wasted no time in suggesting this üòâ. Visited Gachibowli branch which is above CCD and is in the same building of Up the Bistro.
Their ambience does comply with their cuisine to most and their seating is quite comfortable and can seat up to 40 pax comfortably.
Pricing is a bit on higher end with most of the dishes are priced above 350 and very few are between 250 - 350 . A tummyful meal could go up to 1400 for 2 AI.
Have ordered Manchow soup to start our meal which satisfied our taste buds. Red Chilli Prawns (dry), BBQ chicken, three treasure veggies and honey glazed potato balls were part of appetizers. Prawns Teppan yaki, pan fried and tossed along with Chilli Garlic and butter tasted real good. BBQ chicken was a decent attempt and could have been more better. Show stealer among appetizers was definitely honey glazed potato balls which were delicious with a punch of sweet and a little pepperish, a wonderful combo to your taste buds. Three treasure veggies had broccoli, baby corn and mushrooms and felt more like a salad for me. Had it been a little more pan fried with its sauces, could have done wonders.
Among main course was schezwan fried rice and CP special noodles which is made of pan fried noodles and oyster sauce, tasted Okish as sauce did not impress me as much as I expected. Schezwan rice was delicious though, right to the spices. Requested for desserts and they dint have anything from their menu except honey noodles üòï.

Service : Though their service is quick, staff is not so attentive to the customer for the ad hoc requests and also to take order. Something that is important from customer point of view.

Bottomline : there were few misses and few hits. However, most of the dishes were towards sweeter side. I wouldnt mind another try here and see if my first visit is just an exception.",3.5,"310 Reviews , 2001 Followers",1/22/2017 0:47,10,

Chinese Pavilion,Sattam Ray,"Amazing food,good ambience & great service...this is what describes Chinese Pavilion. Their Chinese is blended in Indian flavors & that is what makes it so special! The chopsuey,all chicken non veg gravies are worth trying here along with fish/prawn starters. The best part about their food is it isn't bland,it is mixed with Indian flavors ensuring the Chinese name stays to it preventing it to be less spicy. If you want to try something different within the Chinese cuisine this place won't disappoint you. And the service is awesomely good as the servers there wont just serve you with a smile but also recommend their best dishes and can even customise your dishes as per your choice. I am going with a 4.5 because I beliebe the efforts put by their team should be appreciated and I request every foodie to visit this place.

Chinese Pavilion,Karthik Gandhi,"Chinese Cuisine including diverse styles from various parts of chine has not only influenced the food landscape in various parts of Asia but across the world. One of the most simple yet complicated in flavor profiles. India has also embraced so much of Asian cuisine that you can vouch that most of Indian Foodie community next to their regional cuisine would be fans of Chinese Cuisine. Chinese Pavilion is one of the most consistent brand in Hyderabad that you keep hearing for authentic no non-sense Chinese dishes at not to alarming prices and yet have strong fan following.  I for one of them was a fan as I dined here last year and fate had me to dine her with Fellow Foodie Bhais exactly after a year and I had to be blown away by the food only to believe that no wonder this place has been awarded The Best Chinese Restaurant 2016 from Times Of India .

Chinese Pavilion,Gopi Krishna,"Searched for Chinese cuisine nearby and I found this cuisine with better rating but with high costs. Thought of visiting this place and really it made my day.
As soup is one of my favorite dishes I started with Spicy Crab soup.
It was good but found something was missing in it.
I tried to do some modifications and added sugar and venigar which made it awesome.
Thai Basic chicken fried rice was good. Not that Spicy but I the rice was very dry. It might tasted better if it was bit wet.
Betki fish tossed in crab meat was very good.
That was a great experience with a great ambiance and good service.

I have visited its other branch in Banjara Hills many times and have always liked their food.... So wanted to give this branch a try.

Food here is great too..

Dishes ordered:
Pepper fried Paneer - I personally don't like starters if they are very crisp so couldn't enjoy it much....

Pan Fried Noodles - Amazing :) Loved it!!

Restaurant is located near the Gachibowli highway on the 1st floor above CCD. Restaurant had nice interiors and we were greeted in a warm manner. The staffs were very courteous to explain us the dish details at the time of order. We ordered for POTATO BALL HONEY PEPPER SA, DUMPLINGS, VEGETABLE MANCHURIAN, VEGETABLE BLACK BEAN NOODLES, 3 TREASURE VEG CHILLY. All Dishes were served spontaneously and all were almost authentic chinese dishes. There was no soup provided along with dumplings as is provided in Kolkata shops. We were disappointed with Manchurian as they were too much salty. Noodles were perfectly cooked but the babycorns needed to be boiled a bit. Overall a wonderful experience as we spent more than 2 hours eating n chitchatting with friends. We also had cakes which we brought from outside. They were very much cooperative to allow us outside food.

So, when I heard that they have opened another restaurant in Gachibowli which is near to my home, I was excited and took my family to dinner. First of all, the ambience is a huge let down. It looked like any budget restaurant and I was thinking whether I should get out or go in. Finally, went in expecting some great food.
We ordered noodles, fried rice, a lamb dish and a brownie. First of all, the prices were exorbitant for the ambience and the overall experience. They are providing a 3* experience and asking for 4*/5* prices. The fired rice was great but the lamb was undercooked. The desert was a disaster. Overall, please avoid this restaurant.

Excellent serving time, all items arrived on time infact for a change had folks asking if we want to hold a little while before getting next dish out? These things matter a lot when u r paying to eat out.

Now food - Jade chicken soup, nice spinach based creamy stuff, gud way to start the meal. Accompanied by house salad of cabbage and cucumber kimchi, nice dressing but cabbage cut could have been good. Fish cakes were good, loved it and accompanying sauces were awesome. Main course was Mix XO rice of chicken and prawn, well that was the downer. Nothing exciting abt it, maybe shld have coupled with a curry but then Nash, fried rice u shld be able to enjoy dry. Desert - blue berry cheesecake, so here is where me and wifey differ, I thght it was worth it, she says the base wasn't crunchy engh. So try and rate yourself.

Chinese Pavilion,Ramandeep,"Bad rating is mainly because of ""Chicken Bone found in Veg food"" and is not acceptable for a Vegetarian.

To satiate Cravings for chinese food we headed to Chinese Pavilion and there was also a voucher available in Little app for Luncheon tray for Rs 310 (Veg) [well do not bother for the voucher as the price for Veg Luncheon tray is Rs 275/- + taxes in the restaurant itself).

The ambiance is decent and since it was noon, not many tables occupied so it was pretty quite.

It was Thrusday special (Veg):
Hot and Sour soup: was just OK - well it had sprouts which were crunchy in your mouth: something different.
Kimchi - salad (personally i'm never fond of it)
Potato in plum sauce - this was very good and well made
Brocolli, Baby corn, Mushroom in spicy sauce - this dish lived to its name 'too spicy'; but was fine with fried rice
Veg hakka noodles - was good
Veg fried rice

Overall the food tasted good until a piece of chicken BONE came into my friend's (he is pure vegetarian) mouth while eating noodles. It was such a disappointment and complete experience was ruined.
Well Management did apologise but surely they cannot put things correct and were offering of not using coupon but we surely don't want to visit the place again. I requested to see their kitchen if they really segregate pans for Veg/Non-veg cooking which Manager declined which makes me believe they don't.

Staff and service are fine but they really need to improve the segregation of Veg and Non-veg as in Indian Culture it means a lot.
