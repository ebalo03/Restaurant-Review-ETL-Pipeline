Sardarji's Chaats & More,_ Gluttonous Hedonist,"The food is economically reasonable. The North Indian dishes including chole kulche, chole bhature and paneer butter masala are comparatively better than the chaats.",3,"12 Reviews , 4 Followers",5/23/2019 21:34,0,
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Minocher Hansotia,"Oh ho this place serves amazing parathas and their combos are worth it.. You experience it to appreciate it.

Sardarji's Chaats & More,Clifford,Been there for couple of times hoping that they will improve in terms of quality and service but honestly if you really want to eat some dumplings mix with 2or 3 pices of potatoes or paneer or whatever then go there and I bet you you will curse yourself later the funniest thing is that they don‚Äôt even know how to make a proper paratha or kulcha they are just making fool to everyone on the name of ‚ÄúNorth Indian Food‚Äù instead search for another joints in Madhapur or Gachibowli like ‚ÄúParathas and more‚Äù or ‚Äújust paratha‚Äù there you will get the real authentic food.,1,"3 Reviews , 3 Followers",4/16/2019 5:30,0,

Are you veg. lover, then it will be like paradise for you. They server many varities of Kulcha, Paratha, Vada pav, Sand wich  & Chats. Loved Aloo kulcha and Dal makhani like hell. Paratha and Vada pav are yummy. We have Mixed Veg Paratha and the taste was good with many veggies in it. Vada pav was considerable (nothing can beat Mumbai's vada pav). Had Lemon juice but didn't like that, we have opted for this as there is no Lassi point in time. Over all good food with good price.",4,"49 Reviews , 133 Followers",3/24/2019 21:13,2,

Sardarji's Chaats & More,Shalini Mukherjee,"Sardaarji's Chaats & More serves really good punjabi food. If you want reasonable and tasty punjabi food, this place is a really good option in and around Gachibowli. As the name suggests, they have amazing chaats.

I have tried parathas from a lot of places in Gachibowli. And found the perfect places for parathas! But this place not only has tasty parathas, but the price is also very reasonable. The only problem is the packaging. It's not horrible. You can work with it. But comapared to a lot of other places, it is not that great.

Aloo paratha combo had two big parathas, pickel, raita and onions. It was delivered hot and fresh! Papadi with dahi was delicious! The curd was smooth and creamy, not at all sour, and had a tangy sauce added in it. The papadis were very crispy and crunchy. It was topped with green chutney.
The quantity of the chaat isn't a lot. So, if you're really hungry, maybe order two of these or order something else with it.
I'll definitely try their other chaat options soon!

Since, I never visited this place, can't talk much about the hygiene of this place! But overall, the experience was good.",4,"20 Reviews , 41 Followers",3/14/2019 0:16,1,

Sardarji's Chaats & More,Pavan Rishit Meka,"This restaurant is famous for quick bites and street food. It is located in Indra Nagar, Gachibowli which is the most accessible place for techies in Hyderabad. This place is little congested and hygiene is not well maintained.

We get all kinds of street food like Chaat, Pav bhaji, Paratha, Chole bhature, Rajma Chawal etc. We had chole bhature and this was the best that I had in the recent times. If you want, you can get extra chole curry. And the butter milk and Lassi here has the Punjabi essence in it. You will be full after having one plate of chole bhature along with Butter Milk/Lassi.

If you're in search of proper north Indian snacks or street food, do visit and try food from this restaurant. The cost in this restaurant is very affordable. For the quality and taste of the food it serves you will feel that the prices are very reasonable.",4,"64 Reviews , 540 Followers",1/27/2019 4:28,1,

Sardarji's Chaats & More,Namit Agarwal,"Sardarji's gives you a feel of North Indian chat and Chole bhatoore outlets. They have that similar arrangement outside where everyone have to stand and enjoy their chat,pav bhaji,chole bhatoore on high tables.

I recently visited Sardarji's and tried lot of items of it

Gol Gappe (3.5/5)
Gol gappes were good but the Paani can be made more tangy.They only have one varieties of Paani,and of you want to slightly sweeter version then they will include the red chutney in it.

Aloo Tikki (4/5)
Aloo Tikki was very good. Red and green chutneys were perfect.

Samosa (4/5)

Chole Bhatoore (5/5)
Chole Bhatoore were amazing.Do eat those bhatoore on the outlet itself and the essence is destroyed of you order them at home.Choles are also very tasty.

Looking forward to try more of their items.Their Naan size was huge and other items looked very tempting.

The sandwiches, especially the samosa grilled one is a unique concept and tastes incredibly awesome. The dahi bhalla, dahi papdi's are good too. 
However, off late i get the dishes home delivered most of time time via zomato and there are fluctuations in the food.

Another complaint i had with them are their parathas, they are bad, polar opposite to their chaat dishes. I would never recommend anyone ordering paratha's from this place and I tried twice and on occasions they were under stuffed and undercooked.

Sardarji's Chaats & More,Aparna Wani,"If you dont want to deliver the food then dont accept the orders in the first place and the cancellation call from zomato comes when you expect your food. Be careful while accepting the orders or at least dont make  the hungry people wait even to know about the cancellations 

Giving 1 star bcoz cant rate below that",1,6 Reviews,10/11/2018 23:09,0,
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Shivam,"Punjabi food gets you?Well go there soon then. Their chole bhature and club grilled sandwiches are something which are really amazing even the best joints can't beat.

There's no ambiance or proper sitting but it's worth it!",4,"19 Reviews , 39 Followers",10/9/2018 21:10,0,

Sardarji's Chaats & More,Akhil Puri,"If there was an option of putting up 0 stars, I wouldn't have hesitated. Look at the kind of food they offer. I had ordered this 'Aloo Kulcha Combo' from this restaurant. A burnt kulcha, and not even a bowlful of Dal was served. The combo mentioned pickle as well, but that wasn't sent either. Despite complaining them with requisite proofs, no action was taken. TERRIBLE!",1,"1 Review , 180 Followers",10/6/2018 12:27,2,
Sardarji's Chaats & More,Narasimha Sahu,I order a veg biryani. It was cold when it reached me. The taste was just bland and they had 1/4th of the biryani filled with half cooked beans. Even the cauliflower was not cooked properly. They should just remove the biryani from their menu forever.,1,"6 Reviews , 44 Followers",10/2/2018 16:08,0,
