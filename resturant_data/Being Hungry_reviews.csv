Being Hungry,Dr Foodie,I ordered paratha and kulchas from here yesterday night and out of 3 ..2 were burnt . Taste was horrible . And when we complained in zomato chat they gave 27 credit points .. as if that makes up for everything . Our order was of much more value and then we had to order again from some place else coz no one will eat burnt food like that. Horrible service by Being Hungry and Zomato . They don't take their customers seriously at all . Will never ever order from this place again nor will my friends order from here again.,1,"66 Reviews , 1027 Followers",5/21/2019 8:31,1,

Being Hungry,Pratap,"Ordered Paneer Masala Curry and Butter Naan through Zomato. Delivery was quick and packaging was perfect.
Paneer masala was little bit spicy and tasted ok, paneer pieces in curry were less though. Butter Naan was soft, liked it.
Had also tried Chicken Biryani from this place, taste was ok. Biryani rice was flavourful but the rice was little undercooked.",3,"76 Reviews , 64 Followers",3/5/2019 7:54,0,
Being Hungry,Veggie-Lover,"Pocket friendly, sumptuous and decent quality.

This place is my goto for late night deliveries. Their Kaju Biryani is a personal favorite.

Well flavoured rice with a generous helping of cashews fried in butter, this one is comfort at its best.

Their other options are good too and the helping is perfect for two.",3,"96 Reviews , 1069 Followers",2/11/2019 16:02,0,

Being Hungry,Keerthi M,"We went many times along with my office colligues to being hungry. The place was very small and congested. We have ordered chicken lollipop, dry veg munchurian , kaju pulao,egg biryani,chicken biryani, panner biryani, chicken drumsticks,chicken 65. All starters are simply superb.I liked veg munchurian very much.coming to pulao and Biryanies, chicken items are simply superb. But in panner and kaju pulao the masala is very less. I felt like I am eating plain rice. If they would have been added little bit spices it would be great. But after that I have ordered veg munchurian dry many times.",4,"48 Reviews , 15 Followers",11/18/2018 16:38,0,
