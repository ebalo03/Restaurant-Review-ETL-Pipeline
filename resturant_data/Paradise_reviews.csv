Ambience at this place is great; however i was not really impressed with the food and service.

We ordered :
Chilli chicken : 2.5/ 5
Paneer tikka : 3.5/5
Chicken masala : 0.1/5 ... lowest rating possible
Chicken biryani: 3/5
Garlic naan: 2/5

The staff were least bothered and kept us waiting for like 20 mins jus to take order and after all that the food was very disappointing. This is only a much hyped restaurant. I would not go and recommend this place to anyone for frequent dine experience.",1,"7 Reviews , 2 Followers",5/16/2019 20:26,0,
