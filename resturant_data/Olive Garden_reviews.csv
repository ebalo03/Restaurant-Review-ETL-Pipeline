Olive Garden,Smrati Saxena,"I ordered noodles and manchurian combo from this place, first of all i would like to suggest management to send fork along with the food as they have only sent the spoons and needless to say you cannot eat noodles from spoon. second the quantity was really less of manchurian. some improvement in food is suggested",3,"18 Reviews , 41 Followers",5/23/2019 21:02,0,

Olive Garden,Jayaram,"Been exploring about restaurants in Gachibowli and found this place. Been to this restaurant ordered chicken drumsticks and spl chicken biryani which tasted really good, finally ended with a good dinner. As the taste was good ordered a non veg combo next day and surprised to see a cockroach in the meal. It was really a bad experience to see a cockroach where the restaurant has taken away all the positive views that I had towards it. Please don‚Äôt play with health of customers, it takes time for anybody to order food again if we come across these situations. Please note that Restaurants shouldn‚Äôt be the place to hospitalise customers by making them unhealthy. Apologies will not do anything, maintain healthy and hygiene environment.

In food, I tried Paneer tikka masala, masala kulcha, and some masala Papad. All of them were pretty good. It has the complete feel of a family restaurant and the prices are also pretty reasonable. The quantity of the food is decent as compared to the price.

Olive Garden,Ravi Bajaj,"It was my 4th order with Olive Garden in the last 6 months.  I loved the food from this place and this is the reason I ended up ordering from here multiple times.

This time it was a total disappointment in terms of the Veg Food and the service that was provided.

There was no difference in terms of taste and appearance for Veg Dum Biryani & Veg Pulao.  Both of these dishes were same I don't know how the restaurant makes that difference - still wondering.

In terms of the service, I ordered the food from Zomato at 8.00PM and the time of delivery was shown as 8.55PM.  I ordered it keeping in mind my meeting timing, however the restaurant was able to provide food to the delivery guy only at 9.30 which is like 35 mins late from the slated time.

I would still want to rate the food a 4 even after my bad exp with Biryani & Pualo.

Service wise I would rate this place a 2.5

The manager/executive from the restaurant to whom I spoke over the phone just kept saying one thing that sir we are working on your order and it will take 10 mins.",3,"10 Reviews , 27 Followers",11/21/2018 19:27,0,

The curry and roti was okay and the biryani they served was tasty. Overall the food was not bad with very reasonable rate.

Olive Garden,Naveen Kumar,"Have been here many times. I was a frequent at their madhapur branch since 2006. Its a quiet place and family friendly. The lift is old, dark and horrible. It feels it will breakdown, except that it doesn't. They tried installing another lift but that turned out to be scarier that the first one. Coming to the food. Its just okay. Nothing outstanding or too bad. Starters and Chicken items are usually good enough. Their tandoori chicken doesn't have breast portion. I couldn't understand the rationale behind it, its just leg, thigh and wings. And yes I don't know why they have downgraded their crockery. They serve curries in smaller household type steel bowls.",3,"23 Reviews , 6 Followers",11/3/2018 11:17,0,

Olive Garden,Dinesh Rajagiri,"We've been here on recommendation from my colleague that the starters are on fire since I am a big fan of starters.
So as soon as we reached the spot, we could see that the restaurant was congested and somehow they just wanted to fit in the Gachibowli area. The interior was also tiny and seemed confined.
Anyhow we ordered chicken garlic, chicken biryani as that was a very standard item to test on any new restaurant. The staff were ok, not quick but not rash though. Even though they got our food very late, they somehow tried to convince us with something non-relatable situations.
Forgetting all that, we just wanted to concentrate on our food. As soon as we had our first bite, the first thing that came to our mind was - it's good but not great. The flavour in the Biryani was good but the quantity was on a lesser side when compared to the prices.
Overall, it's a place where you can visit once in a while if you stay/work near Gachibowli. This is not a place to visit from a long distance.

Olive Garden,Age Of Foodies (Suraj Karambe),"New Entry in Zomato Gold-
Ambiance- 
Olive Garden is located at the Time Square, Indira Nagar beside Dominos Pizza. There is nothing much to say about the ambiance of Olive Garden Restaurant. This restaurant is very small, with no live screening and no music. Ambiance is quite boring, as they didn't even decorated it much. Even on the Saturday night, this place was not at all crowded.
Food-
We ordered Chicken Chatpati Kebab as a starter cost approximately INR 255. The quantity of Kebab was very less. They served Kebab with the green Pudina Chutney. Both the qauntity and the quality was not upto the expectations. Then we ordered Chicken Dum Biryani cost approximately INR 210.
This was the worst dum biryani I ever had, that I didn't even tasted like Biryani. Instead of Dum, they added so much oil in that Biryani. Olive Garden offers 1+1 dish on Zomato Gold membership.
Service-
Service here was too slow and the staff didn't even give attention.
