Beyond Flavours,Pragya Sarda,"Short review: Decent breads and starters, bad Shaam Savera, a little screwed up daal makhni (but should be a one-off case)
Better ambience at night... And importantly good quantity!
I wanted to give a 2.5 but that's not an option üôà
Extensive...
Ambience: It's better at night. Friends who had been here during the day didn't like it much. So if you prefer ambience, go at night!
Food! Ordered a Hara Bhara Kebab, Shaam Savera, Daal Makhni, rotis and raita (Yes! I'm a vegetarian üôà)
The good part! Quantity üòç
I was excited to see Shaam Savera on their menu. But take it from me, you do not want to order it. It is no where close to what it should be. They messed it up real bad, especially the colors.
The daal makhni had big chunks of garlic cloves which spoiled it for me. It wasn't creamy too :(
The breads and raita were decent!
The Hara Bhara Kebabs were decent too, soft! They had an extra outer coating of peanuts. So if you're not a peanut fan on your kebabs, ask them to skip that step üôà
Conclusion: It looked like they had made food in a hurry.
Would like to give this place another try hoping that mine was one of the odd cases. If things change, you'll know!",3,"9 Reviews , 8 Followers",5/20/2019 0:35,0,

Beyond Flavours,Sugandha Saxena,"My review of the place comes after multiple visits, that have spanned over 4 months. And now I can safely say that it's one of the good places around.
They're located near the Biodiversity signal, above Fabindia. There's ample parking for both two and four wheelers. The ambience is a bit dim after dark, and the seating is divided into various options, including a PDR section.
The menu design is in the shape of a bottle, and the array spans Continental, Chinese and Indian cuisines. Here's the list of things that I have tried, across all my visits

Panko Crumbed Mozzarella Sticks ‚ù§Ô∏è - Cheese sticks that are coated and fried. Pure cheese bliss.
Veg Lasagna ‚ù§Ô∏è - This place has one of the good Lasagne in the town.
Crispy Chilli Corn Kernels - The usual favourite, this one has a slightly different presentation here.
Makhmali Paneer Tikka -
Cottage Cheese Shashlik Sizzler
Italian Nachos - Nachos topped with red sauce and cheese, and baked in the dish.
Cheese and Cheese Pizza ‚ù§Ô∏è - Soft base pizza, loaded with cheese, and a few pieces of green olives.

I cannot stress enough on how I have loved all that I tried here. I have also tried out their lunch buffet. The variety may not be as elaborate as other places, but with the food quality and the discount that they offer for bulk bookings, it is at least a one-time try. But what I really adore here is their mocktails. Beyond Delight is an absolute delight! Also a fan of the Guava and Chilli, and Apple and Kiwi Night drinks.

The staff is ever so courteous. A special mention to Papiya and Shuvro, who were our attendants on the latest visit. The place has Zomato Gold 1+1, which further brings down their reasonable rates. A meal for two would roughly be around 700, that fills not only your tummy, but also you heart!",4,"150 Reviews , 2135 Followers",5/18/2019 14:53,7,

Beyond Flavours,Sind Hu,The reason for giving only a 3 star is because of the longlong time wait for the tables. We went on Friday afternoon. We waited almost more than 30mins to get a table.

Beyond Flavours,Dyagamrahul,"We went for lunch buffet yesterday and took a chance after seeing some good and some average reviews in Zomato.

The spread in buffet is too less, just 3 veg and 3 non veg starters, 2 main course in veg and non veg, just one fried rice and chicken Biryani.
Desserts are ice cream and jamun.

The taste was ok and not to expect too much. Little disappointing when starters are not hot.

Fish fry was decent, Schezwan chicken was ok.
Veg spring rolls were too good.
Big surprise for me is Onion rings as starters ü§£üòÇ

Kadai ghost in main course was good but missing that masala flavour.
Chicken was ok. Biryani is average, egg fried rice was good.

For the money we pay, we expect some good food. They use much of colour in food item's.

Suggestion to management is use less coating and less food colouring in starters.

Overall experience is ok, but they can be much better for the amount you pay.",3,"25 Reviews , 24 Followers",5/16/2019 7:13,0,

Non veg : chicken kebab , chicken manchurian and fish .Fish was very tasty though it coupd taste better if it was hot.Chicken was fair enuf.
Singapore Noodles,Egg salad and pasta : They were good but it was cold.
Main course: mutton rogan josh, chicken tikka masala,palak paneer All were equally good
Biriyani: Egg frued rice and chicken biriyani were really great.
Desserts : moong dal halwa tasted really yumm, ice cream,gulab jamun,cut fruits,banana cake

The staff were too slow in service and the food was refilles very slow.We had to wait for quite long time to actually eat to stomach full.

Beyond Flavours,Mudit,"I have been at this place for dinner a few days back. The ambience was good. The restaurant was almost half occupied. We immediately got a table. But then waited for 10 mins to get water and menu, that too after a few reminders. We ordered a few starters, main course items and mock drinks. Only the starters could be served in 30 mins. There was no sign of mock drinks! We noticed similar service issues on other tables. Noticed guests literally shouting on the staff.

The food was just average. Dishes were not prepared well, at least when compared to 4.1 rating on Zomato.

We finally decided to just have starters, and hop onto another restaurant for rest of the meal!",2,"1 Review , 2 Followers",5/12/2019 8:37,0,

1st time it was with colleagues and I loved the food and ambience and service and everything except the prices as it was too costly. Their special baked biriyani is work a try, it's unique and tasty.
Because of the good experience I revisited this place with my sister. She orders a mocktail and it was terrible.they replace it but it was still not good. And then I asked them about a starter, if it was with bone or boneless and they told me it was boneless, later on the arrival they told me that it comes with both.

Beyond Flavours,Vignesh Rk,"I would like to introduce this restaurant to a new ingredient called salt. If you add that yo your food, it would taste way better. So basically none of the food we ordered had salt. We ordered Fries, panko mozzarella sticks, Tomato cream soup, panner65 & ""Italian"" Nachos. Not sure how that was nachos or italian. They basically bought a pack of dorittos and added mozarella cheese on top. The beans were not baked at all, and the entire dish was cold except for the plate that it was brought in. Pretty sure they just dumped the items and stashed it inside a microwave. The paneer 65 was horrendous. Might as well called it garlic 65 with no salt. Next was the mozarella sticks, which was again cold and no salt. The only decent item that we got was the fries and the soup. Thanks to gid we didnt order any main course. All these came up to 1300 and odd. Thanks to Zomato Gold, our price went down. This place is way too expensive for the quality of food they serve. And talking about the restaurant in general, the place looks decent but there are stoves stashed under tables and seats and plants kept at inconvenient spots. They really need to clean up more.",1,"13 Reviews , 67 Followers",5/11/2019 10:06,6,

Beyond Flavours,Sreshta Ladegaam,"This was my worst experience at a restaurant ever. First our starters were served after half an hour of ordering and the chicken popcorn had a hair strand in it yuck! Then the guy who took our main course order forgot about it completely so we had to order again after waiting for almost an hour. Then had to wait for another half hour to get our food. And the worst of all, they got us chicken lasagna instead of veg lasagna. We figured out that it was chicken right before one of my staunch vegetarian friend almost ate it. I do not recommend this place at all. There are so many better places in Gachibowli that could save your time and provide better service.",1,"25 Reviews , 722 Followers",5/9/2019 12:37,0,

Beyond Flavours,Gaurav Saini,Was there for office lunch outing. Rating would be mixed because food was fine but service was very bad. Booked table a day before but still had to wait for 30-40 mins to get one. Manager was polite but gave some rubbish reasons for bad service.
