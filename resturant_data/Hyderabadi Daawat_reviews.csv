Hyderabadi Daawat,Pavan Rishit Meka,"This is a newly opened restaurant in Gachibowli. It is famous for it's Nizami style of cuisine. It is very spacious and has a cozy ambience with good music.

Dishes that we have tried:

1. Chicken Hot & Sour Soup
2. Chicken Manchow Soup
3. Eight Treasure Soup
4. Chicken Platter
5. Daawat Khaas Sabz Kebab Platter
6. Daawat Khaas Murgh Musallam
7. Zafrani Roti
8. Paneer Pasanda
9. Kaddu Ki Kheer

The food served here is delicious and mouth-watering. The pictures of the famous dishes served here are displayed in the LCD Tv's. Just the pictures themselves will activate all your taste buds. If you are going with a group of 6-8 members, I suggest you order platters instead of individual starters.

We have ordered Chicken Platter and Daawat Khaas Sabz Kebab Platter. The chicken Platter comes with 4 variety of chicken starters with 6 pieces for the each variety. And Veg platter is served with Paneer Tikka Kebab, Tandoori Broccoli and starter of cauliflower. Both veg and Non-veg platters tasted great.

In the main course we have ordered the famous dish of this restaurant *Daawat Khaas Murgh Musallam* It comes with chicken marinated with ginger garlic paste and stuff with eggs and mutton keema. Leaving the Hyderabad biryani aside, this was the best main course item that I have tried in the recent times. It easily serves for 3-4 adults. And it is really a must try dish if you're visiting this restaurant. Apart from that we have ordered Paneer Pasanda with zafrani Roti. The Paneer Pasanda curry tasted little bit sweet and none of us have liked it.

And coming to desserts we have ordered Kashmiri Rabdi and Kaddu ki Kheer. Both of them are really good.

Service:

The service here is really commendable. The staff is cordial and always available at your service. Within no time from ordering they serve the food hot at your plate.

Value for money:

I can't comment on the vegetarian food but for the non vegetarians this restaurant is a treat and the prices are worthy enough. We can try a variety of dishes which we haven't even encountered in the menu of regular Hyderabad restaurants. So mark it and visit this place for your next dining.

Hyderabadi Daawat, A New place in town located at Gachibowli. A place know from serving pure authentic Hyderabadi cuisine! And this has been in my list to visit since this place opened.

Talking about the Ambiance, It's gorgeous, simple and spacious with beautiful Interiors and great flighting.

We were here for lunch and since it was our First visit, we were confused what to order, then we asked the management to send their Signature dishes.

But before that since it was very hot, we ordered for Mocktails.
Strawberry Mojito, Virgin mojito, blue Hawaii, Soda fountain and Mango mule were among the Mocktails we had, They're amazing and refreshing!

Started with Yakhni shorba: Very delicious, Mutton was Cooked properly. Soup was Served very Hot!

Murg Sholay Kebabs: The signature Starter of this Place, very well presented with the Mini BBQ sizzling grills. The chicken was Little hard, should've cooked for a Little Longer.

Wok tossed chicken: Chicken was soft and Tender tossed in sauces, Little sweet. Chopped with Bell peppers and spring onions of Topping. Absolutely delicious.

Phuket Fish: One of the best fishes I had recently, very soft perfectly cooked, Slightly spicy. A Must try.

Sikanderi Raan: the House Speciality! The most Tender meat I've ever had in life, Probably the best you'll get in Hyderabad. Very tender, Full of Masalas and loaded with Ghee. The Marination for the Whole Raan is done 24 hours before and then roasted and served on table. Highly recommended!

Chelo Kebabs: Another House Speciality, The Kebabs were tender, Smokey and Delicious. Served along with Mild Flavoured rice, grilled tomatoes, Sunny side up and salad . A perfect platter for 2 people!

Murg Musallam: I've had this in many places, didn't really like it, But here it was one of the bests I had in the city. Though it takes 30 minutes to cook, it was worth waiting. The whole chicken is stuffed with Minced Meat and Boiled Eggs! Chicken is marinated with many spices and Curd Mainly. Cooked very perfectly, tender and Absolute scrumptious. Served along with flavoured rice! Highly recommended and The Best Murg masallam you'll ever find!

Chicken Tikka Lababdar: Scrumptious, Slightly spicy, chicken cooked right to perfect. No Colors added in the gravy, Just Delicious!

Nihari Gosht: I usually don't order mutton gravies from restaurants, But I had Faith in this palace that they serve good meat. As their mutton starters were excellent, even from the Main course this gravy was Scrumptious. Spicy and mutton cooked perfectly. We had these 2 Delicious curries with Hot Butter Naans! I would Recommend these 2 curries, A Must try!

Mutton Biryani: Very Flavourful, meat was perfectly. Rice grains were of a good quality! Just that they added a Lot of cardamom in it, with which the Biryani gave a Strong Flavour. Tasted pretty good.

Ended the Day with Desserts: Hot Shahi Tukda and Matka Firni. Both tasted Delicious, They weren't too sweet. Perfect to end our day.

Outstanding and Fantastic experience at Hyderabadi Daawat, One of the places to serve authentic Hyderabadi cuisine, No Colors and preservatives. Hope This place will never disappoint! It was worth travelling 25 KM's to visit this place. The staff was Humble and took good care of us.",5,"137 Reviews , 1563 Followers",3/17/2019 13:06,32,
Hyderabadi Daawat,Tummyful_hyd,"Hyderabadi Daawat as the name suggests has some authentic Hyderabadi food which you get to eat in the functions here in Hyderabad! Ever been to a Hyderabadi Daawat before? No not the hotel we're talking about a function, well if you've been to one then You definitely know how much a Hyderabadi loves food and how much he spends on the Menu! And here at Hyderabadi Daawat, the restaurant, you get the same splendid variety of dishes to enjoy! The hotel is very easy to locate! Its on the main road...while coming from ORR or Gachibowli side it comes on the right side and if you're coming from Miyapur side then it will be on Your left! The restaurant has simple yet beautiful interiors, very calm and cozy place! They also have Banquet hall and a Conference hall and they also undertake Catering orders for parties and functions! And after the ""DASTAR"" was set we sat down for the food and they first brought the YAKHNI SHORBA! Shorba is nothing but the soup! Yakhni Shorba is a dish from Kashmir...people in the North tend to have it more! And it is a very good source of protein! Usually it is mild in spice level but at Hyderabadi Daawat owing to the spice cravings of Hyderabadis it was made a little spicy! But the taste was fantastic! It was the best way to start off Your meal! Next came the starters in which we were served the Wok tossed chicken, Phuket fish, Sikandari Raan and Murgh Sholay kebab! Let's start with what we loved the most: The Sikandari Raan! ‚ù§ It's one whole leg from the Goat or Sheep! You know for a fact that Mutton and Beefs aren't usually as tender as Chicken but the chefs at Hyderabadi Daawat changed this notion entirely! The mutton from the Raan was soo soft tender and juicy that Your teeth has no work to do...cause it just MELTS! And talking about the spices...it was very mild in spice and very well marinated! Coming to the significance of the name SIKANDARI RAAN! Most of You must be knowing that Alexander the Great who had captured almost all parts of the world was known as Sikandar e Azam! After winning one of the battles in 300 B.C at Takshila he took the ruler called Porus as captive and when Porus was asked what he wanted He told he wanted them to treat him like a king and soo Alexander or Sikandar took him as his friend and arranged for a lavish buffet in which this Raan was signature dish! And since then it is named as Sikandari Raan! Well, we think no other name would have justified the Size and Taste of this dish better than Sikandari Raan! A must must have for You all! Highly recommended dish if You're here! üòç The next best starter was the Phuket fish! It's a nice spicy fish coated with finely chopped onions, ginger garlic paste and tossed in Soya and Chilli sauce! The taste was of another level! Next we had the Wok tossed chicken! Wok tossed is an East Asian style of cooking where they use woks or metal pans with shallow bowls used for frying or steaming! The taste of the chicken was really good with all rightly mixed flavours and spices but it was a bit hard to chew! Soo we recommend the chef to look into that! And next came the Murgh Sholay Kebab! It was the Barbeque styled chicken! Very nicely marinated and tender to eat! And the presentation was amazingly done! üëåüèª After we were done with the starters they brought a very appealing and extremely beautiful dish called Chelo Kebab! It was extremely well presented! Chelo kebab is an Iranian Dish in which there is cooked rice along with varieties of chicken kebabs! The chicken and the rice as well is too mild in spice but rich in flavour! After this the main course was started in which we were served the Chicken Lababdar, Nihari Gosht, and Murgh Musallam with Butter Naan! Nihari Gosht was Love! ‚ù§ it wasn't like the usual Nihari that You eat on a regular basis! It was different and very thick and spicy! And the mutton which they used was really tender! Do try this dish here! Chicken lababdar was really lababdar along with the butter naan it was a perfect combo! üòç Murgh Musallam was completely different here when compared to the Murgh Musallam we had at other places! Here they serve the Murgh Musallam with rice! And the meat is filled with minced mutton and eggs! You should definitely try this dish! ‚ù§ We were done with all this but how can You even think that a Hyderabadi daawat would end without the Hyderabadi Biryani? We had the Mutton Biryani it was very rich in flavours and seasoned with good amount of roasted onions! The aroma of the Ghee added to the taste of the Biryani! üòçüòç And the Daawat came to an end with the desserts You commonly find in a Hyderabadi Daawat...Matka Firni and Double ka Meetha! Double ka Meetha is the very usual dish You see in the functions of Hyderabad! It is made with roasted breads to which milk cinnamon and almond powder are added! And at Hyderabadi Daawat it was perfectly made and was served Hot! ‚ù§ Overall the lunch here was a Terrific experience and we all just loved it! And also a special mention to the Owner of this place who is a very Kind hearted and a humble person! He speaks to You related anything and everything You have to ask or tell and takes the Feedback whether good or bad with a smile! Way to go Sir! üëåüèª",5,"18 Reviews , 271 Followers",3/16/2019 22:01,6,
Hyderabadi Daawat,Tavleen Kaur Gandhi,"This place is only a few months old. It's true that Hyderabad is filled with various food places that serve different cusines, mainly there are n number of Cafe's, bars, food joints. The new culture has out shined the basic restaurant culture.
Hyderabadi Daawat is that place which will bring back your memories of going to a restaurant to enjoy a good sumptuous meal with your family or friends.
It excells in real flavours used in Hyderabadi dishes and will make your mouth water for their signature dishes.
Starting with the mocktails section, there is a huge variety. From the basic mojitos to the flavoured ones. The signature mocktails and a must try outs are Mango Bloom, Soda Fountain and Strawberry Mojito.
Coming to the starters, it's the best to begin with some soup. Yakhni Shorba is the best try out soup.
Phucket fish, wok tossed chicken and Sholay Kebabs are the other three delicacies in the starters menu. Sikandari Raan.. the signature item from the menu is the show stealer. The presentation is so lovely that would not let you take a picture of it but to devour it immediately.
Heading to the main course, Hyderabadi cuisine is incomplete without biryani. This place has amazing Mutton biryani which is flavoured so well. The aroma is literally breathtaking. Chicken Tikka lababdar and Nihari Ghost are the other curry options which should be tried in the main course along with butter naan. The main ""main-course"" is Murg Massalam, a whole chicken stuffed with lamb and eggs. This dish was superb in taste as well as presentation. After a full on meal desserts are a must. Matka Firni and Double ka meetha were amazing here and should be eneded with after the meal.
The staff here is very polite and friendly. The ambience is serene and calm,goes well while having your meal here. The place has a huge space of sitting area. The indoors are done very finely with good cravings on the ceiling.
Overall its a place you can go to with your family for an amazing Lunch or Dinner. Most recommended!!!",4,"111 Reviews , 568 Followers",3/14/2019 22:31,14,

Hyderabadi Daawat,Saloni GuptaüßÅ,"Probably i am having a bad experience with Hyderabad food these days. So i thought of ordering from a 4* restaurant to be sure.

Ordered masala kulcha. They definitely dont know what a kulcha is and what masala is. It was a tandoori roti. With a little carrot dressing. How can they charge 50 rs for that? Above all this, it was slightly over burnt and had no butter.

Hyderabadi Daawat,Ayoub Mohammed,"Visited Hyderabadi Daawat along with 8 friends for dinner. Surprisingly found this place far too good to my expectations. The ambience, service, food were really gr8. Was really happy to dine at this hidden gem. Ordered Paya shorba which was deliciously made. Succulent paya with equally tasty shorba. For starters we ordered murgh ke Sholay, Phuket fish, rounakhi sheekh kebabs. Every item was a revelation. Gr8 care had been given to maintain the authenticity of each item. For mains we ordered chelo kebab and murgh musallam. Chelo kebab was presented with chicken kebab, and sheekh kebab with tasty ruce. It being a Persian dish, rice was little bland which was complemented perfectly by the combination of both the kebabs. Perfect. And the murgh musallam was as perfect as it could be. Wondered why we have not visited this place before. A definite must visit from me. Keep it up team HD. You rock!!!!",4,2 Reviews,2/2/2019 10:47,0,
Hyderabadi Daawat,Venkatesh Kumar,"Looking at the overall rating & the close promixity to our office, visited this place for lunch along with my team today. Looks like this place is mainly for IT people as most of it is occupied by 3 batches ( 12+). Nothing great to say about the interiors, ambiance it is decent enough. I am the odd man out in the group being the only vegetarian, but will put in words what my colleagues said about the non veg food.

Veg: Not that great, we ordered Panneer tikka & palak sheek kebab for starters, Sabzi Nawabi Handi & butter naan for mains. Panneer is rubbery & not soft indicating it is not fresh. Palak sheek kebab is kind of bland with no taste & not cooked properly. As suggested by the staff, we opted for Sabzi Nawabi Handi which is a bad decision as the taste is not that good. Service wise, they took lot of time in getting our order which is a let down as well.

Non veg: Sikendari Raan is a standout dish whereas the other Murg Musallam is bland with no taste/spiceness to it. Same is the case with Yakhni Shorba which tasted like hot gravy water.

Overall I would not suggest anyone to visit this place considering the inconsistency in the food they served along with bad service.",3,"87 Reviews , 168 Followers",2/1/2019 17:45,5,
Hyderabadi Daawat,Asad Rana,"Ordered chicken Biryani from this place last night and it was delivered within 45 min with good packing.

Coming to the food, biryani was not upto the mark. Rice was quite plain and don't have masala, however it looks amazing but lacks the flavour. there is one thing called less masala or spices but rice here was actually more on the bland side, rice quality was superb but taste was missing which usually Hyderabadi Biryani have. Mirch ka Salan was decent so as the raita, chicken pieces were having some masala and spices but somewhere some of the pieces were little raw from inside and not completely cooked. When eaten with mirch ka Salan and pieces then only there was little bit of taste otherwise it wasn't decent enough also. Ordered from Zomato on special prices otherwise the price tag which they have is high. Didn't found this biryani value for money.",2,"362 Reviews , 4102 Followers",1/31/2019 18:18,1,

Quality- 5/5: The food was awesome, great taste just they should have given some raita or chutney with pulao eventually i was bored of eating pulao, it was less spicy and more sweet
Quantity- 3/5 : The quantity of pulao was good but sabz sheek kebab was very costly just ten piece for 260 rupees is too much
Value for money: 4/5- the quantity was less still it could be considered valuable as the food was very tasty but the cold drink MRP was 20 and they gave it for double price dont know if they added some thing in colddrink from there end that they charged double

Hyderabadi Daawat,Mohd Zubair Ali (Hyderabad.Food.Diaries),"I am a huge fan of regional cuisines. The diversity in our regional cuisines exhibits so much about the range India possess. It also talks about the immense depth in terms of culture and it‚Äôs just a festival of flavors. Cities especially witness the change in the culture and places like Hyderabad is an amalgamation of so many from the Nizams, Rayalseema to telugu cuisines.

Hyderabadi Dawaat is one such place which is trying to restore the age old tradition and bring back the cuisine of Nizams. From slow cooked Raans to delicious Biryanis, the menu for the place is full of culinary delights and I was really excited to go for it.

As I went in for a dinner, we started with a serving of a traditional Yakhni Shorba, a great start to the meal. With every sip, the intense flavor starts to get you. Then there was an array of appetizers that really got me. We had the Achaari Paneer Tikka, where pieces of paneer were marinated in a flavorful tangy achaari mix. For the non vegetarians, we had Murgh Kalmi Kebab where the chicken leg pieces were marinated in a balanced spice mix. The Gosht Seekh Kebab was wonderful as well. It was juicy mutton kebabs and lastly the Patrani Fish. The fish was perfectly cooked and the flavors of coconut cream enhanced the taste.

The restaurant also took the pain to present us their special Sikandari Rann, where a whole leg of lamb is marinated with whole spices and then cooked in a tandoor. It was served on a bed of fried onions, garlic with some Mutton Shami Kebabs on the side. Every single element from that whole ensemble stood out for me and made my day. Moreover, there were also some Persian Chelo kebabs and Murgh Mussallum for us to enjoy, served along with their range of condiments.

 The Rann was not enough and the restaurant decided to bring more stuff for us. We had Gosht Masala, Achari Chicken and Nargisi Kofta all of which was served alongside with some piping hot Stuffed Kulchas and flaky Garlic Naans. The Nargisi Kofta was my favourite of the night. It just had the right balance of flavors and made me go gaga over it. The Gosht Masala was spicy but the Achari Chicken was incredible too. Desserts like Gil-e-Firdaus and Fruit Salad marked the end of our meal.

In a nutshell, the true culture and authentic flavors of Hyderabad is being exhibited here. So, Hyderabadi Dawaat should absolutely be in your bucket list! Go give them a visit!",4,"482 Reviews , 1688 Followers",12/13/2018 14:53,0,

Hyderabadi Daawat,Kamaal Ahmed (zaiqebaaz),"Ask anyone what you like about Hyderabad the most, the answer is always Food! Hyderabadi food has played a pivotal role in making the city one of the most culturally diverse cities in India! Irrespective of which state you are and kind of palate you have, Hyderabadi food will make its way to your heart with its rich generous flavors! But where to eat in Hyderabad? As an ardent foodie, I get this question asked, all the time. So to my non-Hyderabadi friends I have always been recommending legendary Irani restaurants for Biryani and or any Hyderabadi dish. Because i believe the true flavors of a region are found in its oldest lanes!

But that has changed now. Thanks to the unstoppable pace at which the city is growing, even the legacy restaurants have adapted to the change because of the loved showered on them by the urban population. Now a corporate techie doesn't have to travel all the way to the old city to taste an authentic Biryani. The legendary outlets are expanding themselves to every part of the city where they see the love for them! In the last 5-7 years, some oldest names have made a never-before effort to step out of their comfort old city zone and entered the Cyberabad area.

One such new entrant is Hyderabadi Dawat. It is not a legendary name but the people that are running it are definitely lived this cuisine! And its evident in their authentic Hyderabadi food.

Hyderabadi Daawat is located at Gachibowli-Kondapur road. It is a beautiful family dining restaurant with an elegant and royal ambiance. Just how Hyderabadis like it! The menu, as expected, looks as if taken straight out of a Nawabi Hyderabadi Wedding reception!

We were invited to try their exquisite food on a weekday evening! We started with a Mutton based shorba which was perfect in taste but could have been a little thicker!

 The starters started with Achari Paneer Tikka which was surprisingly good. Though not their forte, it had perfect Taste and softness! The veg Shami was another great starter! The only veg blogger amongst us was so happy to experience the unexpected!

Then came the first non-veg starter, the Murgh Kalmi Kebab! Chicken Thighs marinated and then char-grilled to perfection. It had a gooey texture that probably came from the ghee! It was an amazing starter with a great aroma and succulent chicken!

Then came Seekh kebab, something i am very critical about. Because most of them get it wrong with unnecessary spices and artificial colors! But this one at Hyderabadi Daawat made me feel like home! It had the perfect Hyderabadi taste and the meat was fresh and succulent. Had a proper Seekh Kebab after a long time!

Tandoori Jhinga was just good! Nothing great but then no flaws either!

Their special feature of the evening were three great delicacies!

The first one was the Sikandari Raan, a whole lamb leg marinated with whole spices and then char-grilled and topped with dry fruits! It was one hell of a royal dish! But the meat could have been cooked more. In fact, to a fall-off-the-bone level.

The second khaas peshkash was Chelo Kebab Platter! A Persian delicacy that consists of Rice, a Seekh kebab and other kebabs beautifully arranged on a platter! This dish was so beautifully plated, we didn't want to disturb it and just keep clicking it! Nevertheless, the kebab was soft, succulent and full of flavours. Not very spicy though!

Finally, it was time for the king of them all, the Murgh Musallam. A Mughlai masterpiece wherein a whole chicken bird is stuffed with minced meat, boiled eggs. Then marinated with curd and lot of spices and grilled. It is then topped with a thick gravy which gives it a whole new flavor. See the pics and decide for yourself!

That was our Nawabi Hyderabadi Daawat at this royal restaurant!

I'm glad the Hyderabadi Cuisine is now going fine dine!

Ordered Chicken Shorba, which is similar to soup prepared in chicken stew and pepper. For starters ordered Tandoori murgh Adraki, it was served hot and really delightful. The taste was awesome and chicken was properly tandoored. In the same course we ordered the usual tandoori roti and Murg tikka lababdar. Murg tikka was awesome, it was not too spicy nor too blunt, it was perfect gravy with boneless chicken.

Hyderabadi Daawat,Junaid Aziz,"'Say no more!'

Food - The name itself will get any Hyderabadis taste buds jiggle! And certainly it stood up to it's name, the food here was delectable!

I'll list out my favorites first, In the starters I just fell in love with the Murgh Kalmi Kebab, chicken leg pieces marinated in not so spicy mixture, it was delicious and it is a #musttry on my list! I jumped ahead a lil without mentioning the soup because murgh kalmi was magical, likewise Yakhni Shorba (Indianized Mutton Soup) was a great way to get things started! It had the perfect balance of flavours and that subtle amount black pepper does a great job! Sabz Ki Shaami, a mashed vegetable mixture, fried in oil, served with mayonnaise and mint chutney was a good light vegetarian starter. Paneer Achari Kebab wasn't the softest and also the sides were burnt a lil so they need to work on this, otherwise the flavor is pretty good! Gosht Sheekh Kebab, a classic, the salt levels were perfect and the meat was really tender, felt it was a bit dry though. Patrani Fish, wrapped inside a banana (I'm guessing) leaf, was topped with a layer of mint chutney, although the fish was heavenly, I'd love it to be served without the layering of the chutney! Tandoori Jhinga was again beautifully done and it is the second #musttry starter!

The drinks got mixed reactions! Well 60% of them being below average and another 40% being extraordinary, it was a rollercoaster in this dept.! We gave the review to the management regarding the basic ones and soon after that they presented us Cinderella, Caramel Mint Mojito and Mint Cooler which just blew us all away! I hope they maintain the same consistency in other mocktails as well!

The main course had us dying! We were already so full and there was plenty of food left! Gosht Achari, Murgh Achari, the former being a lil more spicier, were just classic dishes being served and when you combine them with nicely done butter naans, there's nothing better than this combination! Nargisi Kofta was another curry, couldn't differentiate much when compared to the other two.

Special mention goes to 'Sikendari Raan' for ‚Çπ1490, it was a treat to watch this magnificent charred leg piece of a lamb on a plate with oozing juices and scrumptious sides! If you're a lamb lover then it is something that'll satisfy all your Mutton cravings! Food gets a solid 10/10! Need to work on the drinks though!

Ambiance - It is a huge property just opposite to SLN Terminus. With ground and first floor seating, it has plenty of space to fill in atleast 130 people at once! Although the place is well lit, I didn't feel anything special being around because right now and always theme based restaurants will give more customer satisfaction rather than just a clean well lit place with good furniture! 'Hyderabadi Daawat' should incorporate anything and everything Hyderabad has to offer in it's culture as nobody else in that area are doing that! I had crazy ideas like making the waiters wear a classic Lungi, have Marfa (Hyderabadi Band Baaja) outside on the weekends, but the classy interiors just don't allow this to happen! Well you never know, I'm not saying that place is bad but they have to add an element of joy! Ambiance gets 8/10!

Service - It was decent! As they're pretty fresh in the market, they'll have to work rigorously to improvise according to the customers taste! The food arrived in an ample time and the table was being cleared every now and then! I'd like every person around to know each and every dish on the menu because due to the unusual names the crowd there will feel disconnected and not know what to order! The waiters, butlers need to push the specials everyday rather than just leaving it on the vast menu they have! Overall service gets 8/10!

Hyderabadi Daawat,Manaswini Buddappagari,"It's always good to see restaurants which focus on Hyderabadi cuisine since it's so diverse and encompasses a lot of different varieties within it. Hyderabadi Daawat does justice to it's name but treating us to good Hyderabadi food.

The restaurant is located on the Gachibowli - Kondapur mainroad with convenient parking. The interiors are classy and comfortable.

The dish that started off the Daawat was the Yakhni Shorbha which was meticulously done - spicy, meaty and the meat was literally falling apart from the bone.
Achari paneer - seasoned with pickle masalas and was just cooked to perfection.
Sabz ki Shami - the textures felt a little strange to me.
Tandoori Aaloo- soft and fluffy stuffed potatos with crispy grilled skins on the exterior
Murgh Kalmi kebab - marinated chicken in mild spices grilled to perfection in a tandoor.
Gosht Seekh Kebab- it is extremely easy to dry out a Seekh Kebab but they nail it here.
Patrani fish and tandoori Jhinga needed a improvement as they lacked depth of flavour and taste.
Their main course comprised of Murgh Mussalam, Nargisi Kofta, Achari Murgh, Shahi Paneer, Dal Akbari, Gosht Masala.
Their Sikandari Raan and Murgh Mussalam deserve a special mention.
A variety of mocktails are available out of which my personal favourites happen to be the Lemon mint cooler, Cinderella ( slightly on the sweeter side) and Coco Baliney.
Their service was exceptional where the minutest details were taken care of.",4,"38 Reviews , 99 Followers",10/31/2018 23:59,17,

Ambience- Decent with ample space. It's a fine dine place you can visit with your family.
Food- This place has lots of splendid non vegetarian options but being a vegetarian, my review revolves around their veg food and beverages.

The food was well prepared and presented overall. I liked the achari paneer tikka in starters. Shahi paneer was my favourite among the main course that went well with their mix roti Basket. Two of my favourite beverages from the evening were Caramel Mojito and Lemon Mint.

The menu is vast and really reasonable. Do not miss this place if you like Hyderabadi cusinie. Even if you're not a fan, do give them a chance as they have a lot to offer at really humble rates.

Hyderabadi Daawat,Yash Kumar Singh,"I have always been a fan of regional cuisines of India for their immense depth in terms of culture as well as tradition. And its not just the flavours on the taste buds, its almost as if you could taste the history of a civilization. And with the imprint Nizams have left on the city of Hyderabad in every aspect, it doesn't even come as a surprise as to why there are an unnumerable amount of dishes in Hyderabadi cuisine.

Hyderabadi Dawaat is one new joint in Gachibowli area which is trying to bring back the cuisine of Nizams by serving dishes from our very favourite Hyderabadi cuisine to the best of its authenticity. From slow cooked Raans to delicious Biryanis, the menu for the place is full of culinary delights.

Coming to the food, I went in for a dinner to sample out their menu with some of my friends where we began the meal with a serving of a traditional Yakhni Shorba which was a flavour-pumped version of a simple mutton shorba and an awesome start to the meal. With every sip, the flavour became increasingly intense with the hearty mutton tartness on the back of the tongue.

Then came an array of appetizers both for the veg as well as non veg. From the vegetarian ones, I personally loved the Achaari Paneer Tikka which had soft pieces of paneer marinated in a balanced pickle spice mix which had just the right amount of tanginess to it. From the non vegetarian menu there were quite a few who made to my favourites including the Murgh Kalmi Kebab - chicken leg pieces marinated heavy handedly in spice and finished in tandoor to perfection, Gosht Seekh Kebab - plain old mutton kebabs with juicy, succulent mutton mince and Patrani Fish - fish covered in a subtle coconut based marinade, wrapped in cabbage and finished in tandoor.

From among the specialties from the area, the restaurant presented us with their Sikandari Rann which was a whole leg of lamb marinated with whole spices like cloves, cinnamon, pepper and cashew nut, finished slowly in a tandoor and served on a bed of fried onions and garlic with some Mutton Shami Kebabs on the side. Each element of the dish was beautiful with the lamb taking the center stage - tender, juicy and delicious. In a similar fashion, restaurant also serves specialty big platters like Chelo Kebabs which is a Persion styled serving of Mutton and Chicken Kebabs on a bed of Saffron Rice and Murg Mussallam which had a whole chicken doused in a delicious ginger garlic marinade and cooked till tender, served again on a bed of rice.

Even after the Rann, the show wasn't over and we went in for mains trying out their Gosht Masala, Achari Chicken and Nargisi Kofta all of which went really well with some hot Stuffed Kulchas and flaky Garlic Naans. Nargisi Kofta was my favourite one which had the same delicious mutton keema wrapped around boiled eggs and tossed in a rich spicy onion-tomato gravy. Gosht Masala was a tiny bit more spicier that the Kofta and had flavourful bone-in mutton pieces. With the Achari Chicken, the restaurant again showed excellence in terms of balance of flavour as the dish wasn't too tangy as preparations in most of the other restaurants turn out to be. Gil-e-Firdaus and Fruit Salad marked the end of our meal with a sweet note, both of which were less of sugar and actually quite good.

The service here at Hyderabadi Dawaat was just as good as their food. The staff was warm and corteous and took care of each and every need for us diners be it a glass of water or a change of plates. I was highly impressed with the kitchen which though took time to deliver the dishes to the table but also put in extreme care to provide us only what was the best. In a nutshell, if you want to experience the true cultural heritage of Hyderabad on a plate, Hyderabadi Dawaat should absolutely be in your bucket list!

Hyderabadi Daawat,Karthik Gandhi,"Hyderabadi Cuisine as such is vast and rich in heritage with its deep roots into the tradition(s) like any other cuisine. Generations after generation, the cuisine has transformed into more commercial and all we know is few kebabs and dum biryani are the cuisine as such. But there is more than just biryani and kebab(s). Once you get to taste real authentic dishes, you will tend to know the richness and diversified delicacies from the land of Nizams. You always tend to get such delicacies towards the other part of the city and what the Cyberabad gets its morphed or rather mostly morphed delicacies. Wait no more as kondapur-gachibowli has got what it has been missing for quite a while. Hyderabadi Daawat opened up recently has a clear agenda of serving authentic dishes to commercial crowd and give them more above and beyond than the regular kebab(s) and biryani. 

My dinner session today had no expectation(s) from it but then the food spoke for itself. Restaurant should be proud to serve some delicacies which you don't get that easily anywhere in vicinity.

Dishes like #MurghMussalam , #MurghKalmiKebab, #CheloKebab, #PatraniFish, #GoshtMasala, #SikanderRaan and many more. While a few dishes went amiss to excite me, all other dishes were completely unique flavors and not quite relatable to palate that's used to typical tandoor/kebab(s). 

Must Try : #AchariChicken, #GoshtMasala, #KalmiKebab, #PaneerAchari, #DalAkbari and #NargasiKofta

Do focus on such rare delicacies when you go dine there and avoid the regular run around the mill dishes and I'm sure you will appreciate the restaurant for bringing you the heritage of culture rich Hyderabadi Daawat Cuisine. I'm definitely impressed with the menu offerings and their service (Mainly Mr. Dilawar was so gracious)

Hyderabadi Daawat,Bismaya Kumar Purohit,"A newbie in the neighborhood calls for a visit and it was a Sunday afternoon we landed.

A quick confirmation via Zomato led to happy welcome as we enjoyed the ambiance and amazing hospitality by the courteous staff.

Menu card was well organized with tabs to make your way through it easier. Earned a 1/2 star!

Ordered Pathar-Gosht and Afghan Kebab as wanted to start off light. As surprising as it can be the Afghan Kebab turned to be the way an authentic kebab should be and not the imitation ones that are spread across cities. Pathar-Gosht was mouth watering as the aroma of the spices was blended perfectly and not to forget the accurate chunk sized that melted right away in the mouth. Another Star earned for Starters.

When in Hyd go for Biryani- So how couldn't we as we ordered Biryanis - Chicken and Mutton. Prompt service by the staff ensured we had them served on our plats without much waiting time !

Taste was good as they took care that the Biryani don't fry away our taste buds or bring tears down eye. Happy to have tasted an amazing blend of aroma and well coked mutton n chicken pieces. Spices were evenly distributed and the texture was smooth and appealing. The colours of the rice was perfectly blended as it reflected the Typical Hyderabadi style.

With tummies full we ordered Blue Mojito and it too scored as expected...Amazing. Time for a wrap up as the Manager Mr. Dilawar greeted us with his hospitality. A true Gentleman he was as he assisted my family all throughout.

My View: An amazing yet serene restaurant to visit with Family and friends. Located conveniently in Main road to Gachibowli, Daawat is a must try if you're around or visiting Hyd. When in Daawat- don't forget to try their Pathar-Gosht and not to forget the Amazing Raan they boast of being their super speciality.

Hyderabadi Daawat,Advait Shiralkar,"the restaurant ambiance was really spacious and cozy. But the food was not so good. the starter veg kabab platter, the paneer was really hard only the aloo was good. we directly went for veg and chicken biryani. which was okay but not so good to. the service was good. i forgot to mention the mocktails that were mojito and ginger peach they were a bit to sweet.",2,"22 Reviews , 52 Followers",9/24/2018 7:15,0,
Hyderabadi Daawat,Nitin Shiralkar,"A newly opened Daawat restaurant on Kondapur road. We visited on Saturday evening without prior booking. The decor is elegant and spacious with comfortable sitting.

We ordered Mojito and Ginger peach mocktails along with Daawat khas veg kebab platter. Mocktails were good but little too sweet. Veg platter was good but nothing excellent. Paneer particularly wasn't so fresh. We directly went for Veg and Chicken dum Biryanis. Again, both were just ok and quality of rice was just ordinary.

Overall the ambience and service is good but food is just average and not so rich. You can visit this place for casual dining with friends and families.",3,"209 Reviews , 4095 Followers",9/23/2018 17:52,6,
