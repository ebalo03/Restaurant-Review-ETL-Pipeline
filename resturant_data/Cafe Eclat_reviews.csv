Cafe Eclat,Jay Mehta,"This place is a hiddengem!

Went to buy their sourdough bread.ended up having their mushroom soup, death by chocolate cake and key lime tart.

Mushroom soup came with grilled sourdough, everything was good about it. The bread could be toasted with garlic butter

The bread itself we ended up using as garlic bread with our pasta at home which was really good. The bread is something we will go again to buy.

Lime tart Was better than expectation . The cream was way too much.

Death by chocolate was delicious, rich chocolate. Was not able to finish in one go, will have to get on it tomorrow again.

Highly recommend this place. Will go their again for there sandwiches/sourdough pizza and burger.",4,"46 Reviews , 43 Followers",5/19/2019 20:40,3,

Cafe Eclat,Naina Bhardwaj,I didn't like the food at all !! We ordered thin crust pizza quatro formagio and it was not thin crust at all with very bland taste on top of that . Then we had the tuna salad which was too bitter to eat . Couldn't even finish it ! Then we went for a very cheese pannini . Another dish we couldn't finish . The bread was too thick to eat ! overall huge disappointment for me !,2,"32 Reviews , 10 Followers",5/4/2019 21:51,1,

Taste is spot on and so is the ambience with comfy sofas.

Cafe Eclat,Moonis Ahmed,"What a great find. Went for a late night snacking/coffee and the food, service, ambiance were amazing.

We ordered Basque Chicken Sandwich and Very Cheesy Panini accompanies with an Iced Latte. 

The chicken sandwich was delicious with crispy sourdough bread and juicy chicken inside. The bread tasted fresh and the sourness was accentuating the flavors. Served with crispy potato wedges and a coleslaw, the whole meal is quite filling.

The very cheesy panini was prepared with wholewheat bread and had a distinct cheese flavor to it. It could have worked with a little more spice but that doesnt meant the flavors were any less. 

Both the sandwiches were gulped down with the iced latte served in a tall glass.

Service was quick and the ambiance was pleasant with good music on play. 

Althought a bit on the pricier side, the menu offers a lot of variety and the place is recommended for their signature sandwiches prepared with their home baked bread.

Cafe Eclat,Vivani,I was so glad when we shifted to our new house because it was so close to this place! This is our favourite breakfast place on a lazy day especially when we are hungover. The Eggs Benedict with salmon is my favourite. Our visit to cafe Eclat is never complete without eating the amazing french toast! Do try it and you would cherish every single bite!

Cafe Eclat,Anil Rao,I ordered from this establishment many times in the past - and all the food was quite good - perhaps unlike anything in Hyderabad.  But today I wished to have the traditional Fish & Chips served in English and Irish pubs in the UK and America.  Theirs is Batter Dipped unlike other (sometimes more expensive) places - and when one adds vinegar and salt to the fish in lieu of the tartar sauce provided (this is really hard  to get right in India in any case)- the result was a delicious facsimile.,5,9 Reviews,4/7/2019 18:15,0,

Plus great Hygiene condition maintained by the kitchen staff.I have been here for breakfast and had English paneer tikka sandwich and iced latte. The quality of bread used is really one of the best.

Breakfast wasn‚Äôt great, would give it a 2/5
They use their own recipes and sauces.

Cafe Eclat,Anoop Prakash,"Boy do I love their bakery products, especially their fresh bread. That whole wheat bread is to die for. 170 bucks, 3 times as expensive as one from old Madras baking company, but 3 times better in taste as well.

They have a nice quiet small seating area which serves fresh continental, and desserts. I loved the quattro fromaggi, as it was made from fresh sourdough bread.

The only reason they lost a star is their high pricing on pastries (400 bucks for a cheesecake for example) and average cafe latte. But am a frequent customer here nonetheless, some guilty pleasures of life.",4,"112 Reviews , 450 Followers",3/7/2019 8:39,0,

Cafe Eclat,Prawal Agarwal,"Went there on a Sunday evening with the intention of having just a coffee and relax - as you do in a cafe. This review is not going to be about the food taste and quality and ambiance (which is good as reviewed by numerous others) but a different thing which bothered me once I started going through the menu - how expensive the place is! I have been to swanky places in 5 star hotels, but they are expensive because they are IN 5 star hotels. This place is at an ordinary location with very ordinary ambiance. Could never figure why my coffee was 300 bucks and the cheese cake slice 400.

Liked a lot, both of them but they should also serve hash browns with the pancakes as the pancakes are small and the portion size was less. The seats were uncomfortable.

We ordered a Chicken Sausage Roll, English Lamb Panini and Spanish Omelette with Hash Browns.
We also had a Roasted Pineapple Yogurt Smoothie.

The Sausage was lovely, and I loved the dressing on the salad. The meat in the panini was extremely well cooked.

The Smoothie had a zing, and was very refreshing.

Cafe Eclat,Amitav Mohanty,"This place has been a favourite since it started. I remember the early days when it was building its repute. One evening, they were asking folks to try out their macaroons to get feedback. Over time, they have established themselves as an authentic place for baked items.
Their croissant is quite good. They are actually one of the few places I would trust ordering a croissant from. They also make tarts and quiches. Their pasta is quite good.

Cafe Eclat,Ankana Chakraborty,"As a compulsive dessert and bread hogger, I was logically drawn towards the menu of this place. And it didn't disappoint.

If you are looking for a doughnut, please move away from those factory line produced, dense, overtly sweet and miserly filled ones. (It's about time they dunk themselves in a pot of acid.) Eclat's doughnuts are exactly what the deep fried yet fluffy bites of joy should be. The Berliners are generously filled and are light enough not to stick to your teeth.

The New York Cheesecake is one of the best I've had in terms of texture. It's rich and flaky when the fork hits it and absolutely melts as soon as it touches your tongue. I do recommend cutting back on the cinnamon a tad bit to ensure it allows the flavours of the cheese to shine through.

The chocolate cake is decadent and comfortably ranks one among the best in the city. The key lime tart is full of flavour with the right balance of tang and sweet.

The taste of the dishes confirms the use of good quality ingredients and an understanding of the technic needed to churn out great products. Keep it up.",4,"10 Reviews , 8 Followers",10/10/2018 16:32,0,

To make a long story short.. you guys charged me twice on the same day and then charged me the same amount after almost 3days of visiting your cafe. Now thanks to that my bank decided my card has been compromised and blocked my card. My account went into negative balance you guys decided to charge me thrice overall and refund me once, my card is blocked and i am pissed. Truly a nightmare experience, all because i choose your establisment by mistake.

Old review:
                         This place was on my bookmark list for a while and I was excited to visit it on Saturday. We ordered a mushroom quiche, a primavera pizza and a grilled vegetable panini.The mushroom quiche was alright but what knocked me out was the price. It was a relatively small piece with a spoon of caramalized onions and a small amount of onions and salad and they charge 150 rupees for that. The pizza was about 9 inches and tasted alright. But its a whopping 500 rupees. The grilled panini is pretty much the same.I know the restaurant is all about european cuisine but they dont have to make their prices european as well. I had pizzas or quiche that tasted a lot better at a cheaper price. Dont get me wrong the food isnt horrible but its alright. But it does feel bitter after you pay the bill lol",1,"97 Reviews , 97 Followers",8/27/2018 13:17,3,

Cafe Eclat,D,"Very interesting choice of food, so far whatever I've tried from the cheese & tomato croissant, pastries, spaghetti, pasta to the biscuits, all have been top notch.

Cafe Eclat,Ria@ Travelfoodism.com,"Enjoyed the Mushroom & spinach sandwich, felt that it could have had more flavours to it. Chicken pasta was also ok and the side bread tasted good. Liked their idea of serving water in colourful glass bottles. Location is amazing and ambience is nice being a small cozy place to enjoy quiet meals with your family & friends.",3,"204 Reviews , 2422 Followers",7/21/2018 23:20,4,
Cafe Eclat,MVK,"Menu here is very interesting and we went with lot of expectations. 

For starters ordered - Chicken Broccoli Melt and Stuffed Bell Peppers. 

Chicken Broccoli Melt is basically garlic bread with a mixture of chicken, broccoli and cheese on top. The plate served to us is cold, we were told it is in fact properly cooked but broccoli tasted raw. Luckily the chicken is not raw! Bread is very hard and difficult to eat. Overall not worth ordering. 

Stuffed Bell Peppers - Tasted just ok. But loads of spinach used as stuffing and it kind of brought down the taste as a whole. 

Aglio E Olio - No complaints about this one. Tasted fine. 

Cabonara Chicken Pasta - So bland and tasteless we were not able to complete this. 

Quattro Formaggi Pizza - It is very difficult to spoil a pizza these days and even small road side establishments are churning out pizzas that taste good. So much for the authentic 4 types of european cheese used for this one but the taste is very weird and the after taste is really bad. 

Overall, very bad experience which is forcing me to give a rating below 3.",2,"38 Reviews , 128 Followers",7/21/2018 22:29,0,

Cafe Eclat,Rishav Verma,"A simple ,comfortable yet westernized setup which I highly recommend for morning brunch or evening snacking. Its a cool place to hangout with friends or partner. It definately deserves 4.5 for the items they serve during these times of the day.
Recommendation :
1. Sour dough bread (if you are a real bread lover, and other different variety of breads)
2. Eggs/Omlette meals, Pancakes are amazing if one is planning to go for breakfast/brunch.
3. Shakes / Coffee also gives a goodie goodie feeling.
4. Sandwiches(both veg/non-veg) be it all kinds comes under safe options and they result to a good takeaway.
5. Peruvian Grilled Chicken ( highly recommend)
Quiche & other small bites are also nice trials.",5,"11 Reviews , 51 Followers",7/14/2018 14:19,3,
Cafe Eclat,Jatin,I ordered the BBQ Chicken Panini from another delivery service and they gave me a normal sandwich with soggy bread and stale chewy chicken cooked in bad oil.

Cafe Eclat,Slo,"This has been a good find! Almond and au chocolate croissants were buttery light and delicious. Mushroom quiche though small, was filled with umami, served with caramelised onion. Their sandwiches use their own artisanal bread which gives great taste and texture. I love that their bread, pasta, pizza base, etc is all made in-house with quality ingredients and no preservatives and artificial flavouring. This is rare, and so nice! There's also some great looking fresh breads for sale‚Äî we picked one up, wrapped in paper.

There may be room for improvement with the coffee‚Äîmaybe stock some artisanal coffees from brands popping up in the country?

Overall, I'd recommend Eclat over a lot of the generic so-called cafes. People complaining about the price are better off visiting a Cafe Coffee Day.",4,"4 Reviews , 9 Followers",6/1/2018 11:12,0,

Cafe Eclat,Arjun,"I loved the feel of the place as soon as I entered it. Though small but it's well maintained and gives you a cosy environment. Give the bakery items it specialises in, the spread of their menu was quite elaborate and gives you good options to choose from.

The preparation is rich, fresh and gives a good after feeling once you've eaten it. I'd specifically mention the croissants that just melt in your mouth. The Almond Croissant, Pain Au Chocolat are must try. Tomato and Cheddar Cheese Croissant too is something that was different and relishing. The hot chocolate beverage too was consistent and wasn't too sweet or bitter, it was just apt.

I'd certainly go to this place repeatedly and try the other items too. But I'd recommend going to this place and having it then and there as the delivery orders don't usually come on time and thus spoil the taste of the preparation. It's best to indulge yourself in the sins at the cafe than inviting the guilt home ;)",4,"266 Reviews , 1559 Followers",5/16/2018 22:33,7,
Cafe Eclat,John Benedict,"Came here on a hectic Monday.
Service was quick. The croissants were neatly baked and the cake pretty great as well.
I liked the part where they hand make and bake all their products. One can see the kitchen area through the windows.
The cake was neat as well and the coffee great,
This place opens at 7 AM hence making it a quick stop for breakfast and closes at 10 PM so makes it a great spot at all time. 
Prices are little on the higher side but it will all be worth it.
Will come here again for the great food.",4,"63 Reviews , 334 Followers",5/15/2018 19:13,10,

Cafe Eclat,Divya Iyer,"The first time I had something from Cafe Eclat was when we ordered Snack-boxes for a work event. Though a tad pricey, everything in that box was fresh and delicious - especially the complimentary brownie they had added.

We then went to to try out breakfast at this place. They have all the items that make a good continental breakfast, and also a variety of Omelettes. We ordered the Omelette meal, and the spinach and broccoli Omelette. We also ordered one of the pancakes for my daughter. Everything arrived fresh and hot, and tasted great. In fact, I am wondering how I let go of the Belgian waffles on their menu. The portion sizes were perfect and made for an indulgent start to the day.

The next I visited was for a midnight dessert run, and tried the Rocher Caramel - which is basically chocolate mousse encrusted in a nutty rocher, much like your Ferrero Rocher, only larger. Man, that was huge and filled me up completely, but was worth every penny. 

So yes, the place is definitely pricey, but I have to say that they serve you the price's worth in taste and quality. Great place with many options, so must try!",4,"13 Reviews , 50 Followers",5/10/2018 18:16,0,
Cafe Eclat,Ananta Ray,"Went to this place couple of weeks back. Wasnt too hungry so thought of having some light snacks. But seeing the price of pastry at 250 + GST, i decided against it. When you add Art to your tagline, everything seem to be a bit more expensive. I am sure the pastries must be out of the world but for that nice. Not my cup of tea!

Had butter and chocolate croissant which were good and had a chocolate drink with mint which was average. 700 bucks for all this",1.5,"90 Reviews , 300 Followers",5/3/2018 11:44,0,
Cafe Eclat,Aditi Upadhyay,"The spread here looked amazing when we walked in and their promise of all FRESH ingredients made us drool. But we were in for huge disappointments.
They have too vast a menu for them to handle. Nothing that we ordered off the display was remotely fresh. In fact the Mocha caramel cake slice and the cream doughnut were sooo hard that they seemed to have been made at least a week ago.
We ordered their self-recommended Peruvian grilled chicken dish and after waiting for 15 mins were shocked to find a plate in front of us with just 2 small chicken drumsticks paired with 3 different salty sauces. The plate had barely 2 bites of chicken, but sauces that could easily accompany a full chicken!! This, at a cost of Rs. 280, was completely unreasonable for me.
The chicken and mushroom soup was good, but the bread accompanying it was again hard and stretchy enough to have been made a whole week ago!!
Coffee was ok, pretty much standard as everywhere else.
All in all, hugely disappointed with the promises of ""FRESH"" and a complete burn on my pocket with unjustified pricing.",3,"23 Reviews , 42 Followers",4/28/2018 19:55,0,

I had Tiramisu here.. it was good. Though I expected espresso flavour but the taste of mocha was strong in tiramisu ..

You can make your own gelato in a jar here. Sitting arrangement is good and staff courtesy is fine.

I went there on a Wednesday evening and cafe was empty. Crowd must come on weekends I believe.
