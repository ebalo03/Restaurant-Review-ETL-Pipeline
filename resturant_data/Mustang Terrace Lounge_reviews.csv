Mustang Terrace Lounge,Nakul.dhand420,"I went to the restaurant on friday night and have booked the table in the morning itself. But manager denied and said i am giving you a favour for the table. We had drinks but food was pathetic and one dish was replaced when the bill was paid and we have to leave it. Coming to the bill, these guys have started charging some service charge (which is illegal) which will be forced on customers and they expect the customers to pay service charge in cash .I am reporting this to local authorities as they have started booking other restaurants for these illegal things.",1,"18 Reviews , 5 Followers",5/20/2019 14:18,0,

Mustang Terrace Lounge,Td Dt,"First they had some kind of rule like below 21yrs old( I really respect that check) so he asked for IDs at the entrance we dint carry that but we had our soft copies so we showed that.However one among 6of us wasn't having the soft copy we tried ensuring that our friend was 30yrs old but he dint believe and after lot many arguments finally we were allowed to enter.... People are aware where below 21 can go or not so too much nagging is not acceptable...Then comes the service which was pathetically very slow and we were not even given plates to eat we were eating from the serveware itself...There were so many waiters to serve but no one actually paid attention or were not interested I think to attend people,there are many small pubs where only handful waiters are present and yet the orders are attended pretty fast.... Next food was okayish...the only good thing was the ambience....the washroom was totally unhygienic and looked like haven't been cleaned up since long...won't recommend anyone to visit and I personally wouldn't visit the place again",1,"2 Reviews , 28 Followers",5/13/2019 15:05,0,

Mustang Terrace Lounge,Surya Cena,"Located in one of the prime locations of hyderabad, Mustang terrace lounge has an American Cowboy theme with some really good ambience providing both indoor and outdoor seating. The outdoor seating has an amazing view of the city especially at night time.
Food is average to be honest. The french fries and nachos items could have been way better. Chicken tikka pizza was pretty bland. Chilli fish was really good though.
My friends had sex on the beach cocktail and i had virgin mojito mocktail and i must say, both of them were amazing. I had the mint cooler too and i liked virgin mojito better. Definitely worth a try.
The place has zomto gold on drinks which is great for people who‚Äôd like to drink. Overall it was a pretty good experience at this place with some decent food and the ipl screening.",4,"12 Reviews , 55 Followers",4/15/2019 7:47,1,

It's quite, cosy and they play some good music. There are also 2 exclusive places on the rooftop, one which is like one tiny table on an elevation and another like an enclosed area.

We asked for cheese balls, fish tava, chicken 65 and margarita pizza. All these items were good, nothing exceptional but just about right. Recommend- Yes, Must visit- maybe not",4,"64 Reviews , 867 Followers",4/14/2019 19:01,6,

Mustang Terrace Lounge,Satyaranjan Sahoo,"Rooftop bar with perfect ambience for a peaceful time. You'll definitely like the view from the top.

Food was decent with satisfactory service. Music was loud enough to set your mood. They do have a small dance floor. Perfect tiny place!!! Definitely worthy of frequent visits üòäüòâ.",5,3 Reviews,2/18/2019 21:50,2,
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Koundinya Bhogaraju,"Awesome rooftop place to hangout. Dance floor and dj are cool. Service is ‚ÄúTHE BEST‚Äù. The way they welcome you, take care of your order is just extraordinary. Yes, I am a regular here and almost made friends ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. If you are looking for a crazy dance party, you can have an inside table and if you are on a date rooftop is your place. The location attracts the best crowd in the town. Visit on a Saturday and thank me later üëçüèº",5,"3 Reviews , 10 Followers",2/16/2019 22:40,0,
Mustang Terrace Lounge,ManInGreen,"Been here twice. I just love the ambience here.
Open roof top view at nights is something one shouldn't miss.
Service could be better. (Probably because we went on a Friday night. Happening place it is.)
Food too wasn't top notch.
They do have a dance floor. (But not big enough)
Overall it's a fun place to hangout with friends.",4,"14 Reviews , 5 Followers",2/14/2019 13:49,0,
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Pratheek Denny Padinjarathala,"With an impressive location, it could have been one of the prime spots but the placement of items seems unimaginative. The ambiance created with the light bulbs is utterly ruined with a large screen in the middle of the room. The sound system needs improvement with focus on more than just base. 

The food is good and it was worth the wait in this decrepit atmosphere.

The outdoor seats are not as comfortable and there is no measure to tackle scenarios of rain.

It is a decent place to just have food but expect nothing more",3,"10 Reviews , 43 Followers",2/13/2019 11:19,0,
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Pratipurna Panda,"Boy oh boy , the prepossessing set up of rooftop.. the ambience. The beautiful music.. the feeling.. yes, the feeling we got, in this place ..!!

So we just planned out of the blue, to go to a place. Mustang was on the way and we stopped there. Since it was a weekday, we got the top most seating. **Yeah, they have 3 levels of seating. And even the music was not too loud.
Addition to this, coincidentally it was an almost full moon. Everything was set for 'yeh raatein yeh mausam... No 'nadi ka keenara'üò£, but there was 'chanchal hawa' üò¨

Too dramatic??- I know ü§£
Anyway, so we had the topmost seating, and had this amazing, unobstructed view of the clean dark sky with an almost full moon. Could see the road stretched alongside with redlamps of cars.
Don't exactly remember the name of the cocktail, but I think it was wallbanger. And it will get you to bang the wall. üòú Didn't have food, so can't comment. But from other tables, it was smelling delicious. A bit heavy on the pockets. But for the view it provides, worth it.

So, if it's all so good, y one star less? Here goes the answer. All was well until we were about to head out and I decided to go to the little girls room. And guess what..!! I got locked from outside üò≠. Though, after I knocked on the door 3-4 times, they did open it, but how much ever I spent on the cocktails, was drained out with my conscious mind shaking me up with the realization that I was locked.

MESSAGE FOR THE MANAGEMENT: please have at least one staff in the restrooms, till you shut down, to avoid these kind of issues. Plzzzz.. üò•",4,"47 Reviews , 145 Followers",2/13/2019 0:45,0,
Mustang Terrace Lounge,Varunkumar Reddy,"Good place to hangout and chill, the terrace seating is also good, ambiance is ok, we booked a table via @dineout_india, rather than drinks, the food is good here

Mustang Terrace Lounge,Shashi Saini,"I happen to visit Mustang Yesterday with my family and friend and i regret why i chose it at first place.

The service there is pathetic. You order any thing ( even a beer ) it takes them 20-25 min.

Even after repeatedly telling them, looked like they were drunk or deaf. Considering that we ordered main course well in advance but i as expeccted they brought the Veg and Non veg gravy and we waited 20 min for the Roti's to come.

The manager PAVAN, i should say is the root cause of the mismanagement. He had just one answer Sorry, rather then managing the staff and taking to them, he was taking the walk in the park.

One Star that too just of the Ambiance and Roof Top.",1,"4 Reviews , 6 Followers",2/7/2019 11:28,0,

Mustang Terrace Lounge,Mohit,"What can I say about this place. I used to stay in Gachibowli and used to visit the place often. It's a happening place during weekends, not so much during weekdays, but I have never seen it overcrowded (which is why I love it so much). One negative I would say is that the price are a bit higher than their competition.",4,7 Reviews,1/30/2019 23:47,0,
