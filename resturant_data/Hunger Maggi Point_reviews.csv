Hunger Maggi Point,Prabhat Ray,I ordered a shawarma and I received a rotten shawarma. I don't understand why people do this. It's food. Not any product. If you want to increase the price. Do it.

Hunger Maggi Point,Anupam Agarwal,"Its a small joint located near the DLF IT Park. Well who doesnt love Maggi and thats what draws you towards the outlet. You can either visit the place or even place order online. I have tried both methods with varying experience. 
I visited the outlet and Maggi i tasted was much better than when i ordered for home delivery. So one thing probably with Maggi is that you will relish it most of it is prepared and consumed hot without letting it dry. 

Double Egg Chicken Maggi - not as i would have expected it to be 
Double Masala chicken Maggi - definitely worth a try 
Chicken fried Maggi is my personal favorite 

Overall a nice small joint to satisfy your maggi cravings, would suggest order online if you live closeby.

Hunger Maggi Point,Gayatri Tandon,"I've called for their veg as well as chicken fried Maggie a hundred of times just because it is so delicious and has a different taste from all the other Maggie places around. However, 2 days back when I ordered the food, it tasted the same but it had a peculiar smell which has never been there. I took two bites and just left it, those bites created a havoc for me the entire night. It left me with a very bad stomach pain I've never experienced before. Honestly I didn't even expect that it would create such a mess. People always say, avoid street side food which are close to vehicles and all, but this place never disappointed me except for this particular order. So I guess never risking my stomach again.

Hunger Maggi Point,Ashok Prabhakaran,"I used to spot this shop opposite to the DLF IT park while coming back from work during my stay in Hyderabad. Always crowded with majority of the IT people nearby and all other food delivery agents waiting to take parcel. Got to know that they are also delivering till the wee hours of the night.

I was wanting to order from here once for that taste of Maggi. Who doesn't like a fancy maggi noodles? So one fine night, ordered for a Corn Masala Cheese Butter Maggi through Zomato.  That was the most fanciest name I could find on their menu. 

The delivery was smooth and the packing was okayish in a plastic box along with a plastic spoon and fork. The maggi was somewhat soggy and some what semi gravyish which I am not that big a fan of. It could have been a bit drier. But the taste was really good and one could feel all the butter & cheese in the maggi.  Good cost effective outlet for the love of Maggi Noodles.",3,"119 Reviews , 469 Followers",12/14/2018 10:33,1,

Hunger Maggi Point,Hungry Soul,"Strictly vegetarian~~

Late night #needforfood has been taken care by this outlet in DLF for every hungry soul out der but this time I though to order it to my office for my evening hunger. I ordered vegetable cheese Maggie and it came on time and was packed in a white box like you see in a picture.packaging is ok, the spoon was poor quality, could have been stronger to hold the Maggie.The moment I open the box, people around me could smell it and it was great, looks cheesy and yummm. So was the taste, it was good, never dissapoints. Price is nominal as well which is around 50 -70 bucks for various varieties they serve. Deserves a 4.5. I haven't tried the Momo's yet, will add to the review once I try them.

I am sure you have already had this sometime, if not you should surely try coz who doesn't like Maggie right!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è @hungermaggipoint üòÄ",4,"175 Reviews , 1302 Followers",10/26/2018 12:46,2,
