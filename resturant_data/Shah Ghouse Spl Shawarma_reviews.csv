Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Leher Sadhnani,"Was surprised to know that SG runs a Shawarma hub too. All thanks to SG biryani's which made me order Chicken Special Rumali Shawarma from this new venture without even thinking about it. The delivery, packaging, taste and quantity was perfect. Trust me this shawarma was too heavy and yummy. It came without vegetables, and i felt mayonnaise was less and not till the end, it is always best to have little extra mayo!",4,"139 Reviews , 685 Followers",5/14/2019 23:38,1,
Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Avishek Chakraborty,"I ordered their Special Chicken Shawarma from Zomato. First look it was quite heavy for one shawarma. The quantity is huge but coming to cons which is a quality.It is not at all good. The chicken was hard and unnecessarily they made it too spicy also. It usually stays open late night but don't order from here still.The quality needs to improve a lot.
Stay healthy. Keep eating..not from here.

Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Anu Nand,I bought food from them twice. Rumali shawarma and kubbus shawarma. Both were good and tasty. I liked the Libby shawarma more and the Rumali was also good but Libby better. The Rumali was fat shawarma (means the shawarma was mota) the only concern I had was there was a lot of coriander leaves. I should have given instructions. The taste of those leaves were kind of predominant at times. Except that great and the mayo and sauce addition was great and got 2 packets of ketchup as well. Totally; I am happy with the shawarma and cost effective as well.,5,"4 Reviews , 1 Follower",5/11/2019 20:25,0,
Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Bharti Mehta,"Delivery Review :

Ordered a Chicken Rumali Shawarma.

The chicken was so hard that it was very difficult to chew.

Also the spice levels are very high so please add an extra note if you want less spicy.

Overall it was okayish.

Had to throw away half of it as both Rumali and the Chicken were very chewy.

Giving 2 star because they didn't add mayo as requested.

Overall it is just okay and you can definitely find better ones in the city.",2,"84 Reviews , 387 Followers",5/11/2019 16:35,2,

Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Pratap,"Had tried Chicken Shawarma, Lukmi, Samosa, Veg Puff, Egg and Chicken Puff.
Chicken Shawarma, was expecting the taste to be lot better but it was just ok. It tasted bland and mayonnaise was also not upto to the mark. Overall Didn't meet my expectations.

Both Lukmi and samosa were same in taste and preparation, just the shape was different. Better to go for samosa instead of Lukmi, the taste was ok though.

Comming to the Puffs, all were pretty average just like you would get in any other random bakery. Not a big fan of these.",3,"76 Reviews , 64 Followers",4/24/2019 9:11,0,

Drive down there for Shawarma is too much of an ask considering the traffic and the parking hassles. So sit back and order online. My order contained 1 Shah Ghouse Chicken Special Rumali Shawarma and I have regrets over not ordering one more because it left me craving for more. Filled with Hummus and the chicken was just cooked right. It is surely at par with the Shawarma served at Shahi Dastarkhwan, Lakdi Ka Pul. The search for a still better Shawarma continues.

Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Kaushik Padmanaban,"Every foodie I met in Hyderabad recommended this Shawarma. I had just started loving the one from Istah's, but I'm up for a new challenge. My friend ordered one and we shared. It was awesome. It was spicy and tasty. Then, I ordered one myself, but I ordered the one with salad. What a slap in the face. I came with cucumbers and almonds (what?). The rumali was rubbery and biting into it was a battle. Nevertheless, I liked the Shawarma. It's not the best, but it's in the high ranks.
Edit 1: Yesterday I went to Shah Ghouse again. I really wanted to try the special Shawarma to provide an unbiased opinion. To be honest, I was blown. It's the best Shawarma I've ever had. The meat is tightly packed inside the rumali and the quantity is so much. I relished every single bite. Take a bow, Shah Ghouse!",4,"11 Reviews , 7 Followers",12/9/2018 20:34,0,

Lot of crowd and filled with online orders. Delivery boys lining up to take a parcel of shawarmas. Amidst all this rush, I ordered for a Special Rumali Chicken Shawarma for RS 120. Got it in a jiffy and I haven't had much shawarmas before.
 
This was absolutely delicious and filled with Chicken and more chicken along with all of the mayonnaise, sauces etc. I guess I checked out the reviews here beforehand and I told them to make it less spicy. Don't be deceived by the size of it but can be quite filling.  A somewhat pocket friendly quick filling and tasty snack.",4,"119 Reviews , 469 Followers",12/4/2018 10:52,0,

Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Suresh Reddy L,Chicken inside the Shawarma got spoiled and smelling too.. Once opened it and was smelling spoiled.. Before ordering only I thought they might use left off chicken as this is afternoon time... But due to the trust on shah Ghouse ordered it.. And initially shawarma quality use to be very good and now full of mayonnaise and and no dry fruits added to it.. I last order I thought it was by mistake he forgot but even yesterday I ordered shawarma and he repeated the same.. Food quality In shah Ghouse getting bad day by day,1,"1 Review , 1 Follower",9/3/2018 14:50,0,
