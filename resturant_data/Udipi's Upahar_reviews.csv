Udipi's Upahar,Prakash Behera,"This place serve best South Indian food with awesome taste . I had iddli there and it's very floppy and taste is nice . It's better to pack food and eat at home , if you are alone or with friends then you can eat here . It is always crowed",4,"13 Reviews , 37 Followers",4/28/2019 12:13,0,
Udipi's Upahar,Ha,"Very good place to breakfast! Yes, the sitting area a problematic. Even to stand also its bit cramp as this place is always crowded for its best food.

Sometimes my day starts with a lip licking breakfast from here.

Udipi's Upahar,Yada Roopavathi,"Ambience is okay but the food is good. Regular Idly, Sambar Idly, Poori, Mysore Bonda, Dosa are good. Sambar, chutney are good in taste. A definite place to try the food.",4,"124 Reviews , 175 Followers",2/28/2019 16:12,0,
Udipi's Upahar,Ananya,If it hadn‚Äôt been for my friend this place would have simple gone unnoticed. Your typical road side eatery and must have breakfast destinations. The pipping hot vadas are the best I‚Äôve had. Restricted myself to just one vada so that I could try other items. Butter steamed dosa and karampudi idli were good too. Visited this place on both the days for breakfast during my 2-day visit to Hyderabad.,5,"78 Reviews , 1160 Followers",2/4/2019 9:02,2,
Udipi's Upahar,Hari Krishna,"Not up to mark as per it‚Äôs brand name.

Udipi's Upahar,Saketh Vasista,"FoodFor Friends in regards with taste it's too good but if you want to order something you need to be aware of packing.
Packing is not good i ordered sambar idly and they didnt gave me spoon how can a person eat sambar idly with put spoon.
Need to maintain those things other than that food is too good.
I will prefer to visit",3,"7 Reviews , 2 Followers",1/13/2019 13:08,0,
Udipi's Upahar,Ashok Prabhakaran,"One of the best places to have South Indian tiffin varieties in Gachibowli area.  Most cost effective and tasty, quick fast food on offer. I enjoyed the food here and have tried out many times and on almost daily too.  If anyone have any doubt, the crowd that is present here almost all of the time should indicate the popularity of the joint here. 

Situated in a busy area on the Gachibowli main road near to the ORR inter-junction. You cannot miss the place. I have tried out their meals, tiffin varieties, the bhajji & pakodas in the evening and also their tea. Have been satisfied with all of it and do not have any complaints. 

Absolutely zero ambiance and its self service too. Be prepared for the rush and once you get the token, be prepared to be squeezed in a corner to give out your token to the waiters inside. There is no queue system here and they just collect your tokens at random.  When your food item is ready, they spot you and give it to you. Be prepared for some hassles out here as you get jostled around. Finding a spot to eat your food during rush hour is also a problem. There are a couple of tables to sit but majority of the others stand at the tables and eat. Just eat your food quick and rush out. 

My fav of theirs is the Dosa. I just loved the Chutney and the sambar taste even though it was a bit sweeter to my taste. Also loved the Kerala Parotta which is a fav dish of mine back home here in Chennai.",4,"119 Reviews , 469 Followers",12/31/2018 1:50,5,

Udipi's Upahar,Kaushik Padmanaban,"When I first reached Hyderabad, I wanted to eat dosa and idli. Just like the ones I had in Chennai. So, after some research, I reached Udupi's upahar. The sambar was sweeter than I expected. I believe it is the Karnataka style. I still liked it. The Bonda was awesome and the price was comparatively low. Great experience.

Udipi's Upahar,Nalin Venkat Sameera,"I was here with my dad for a quick tiffin/ snack time on our way home. Frankly speaking, I wasn't expecting such good food. We had Masala Dosa, Idli and Vada.

Udipi's Upahar,Mansi Saraswat,"This place is my default option for south indian breakfast. Located right on the Gachibowli-Kothaguda road, this place serves Poha, idli, dosa, uttapam, poori sabzi etc. Personally I prefer their south indian food.
There is a small juice counter outside the restaurant as well.

If you are looking for ambience then this place is not a great option but taste wise and cost wise it won't disappoint you!

I have tried Veg manchurian, gobi manuchurian, idli sambhar, vada sambhar, dahi vada, dosa ( must try ) , puri and curry and poha. I tried one unique combination here and that is plain dosa with veg manchurian, and it was just yummm.
