Eat India Company,Shamekh Siddiqui,"Ambience : Great, perfectly lit and has separate section for smokers.
Food : starters are really good (did not have much variety but were good in taste) , the main course and desert were just like any average buffet. I would say it does have value for money, not that expensive.
Overall : visit if you have tried all the other buffet restaurants and want to to try something new",3,"8 Reviews , 7 Followers",5/22/2019 14:50,0,

Eat India Company,Santosh Pappachan,"This place has a good ambiance and is a treat for people wanting to take pictures but that's about it.

Went on a Sunday and there was no crowd at all. The AC was literally non functional which made it uncomfortable considering the heat outside. The service was on the slower side and the mocktails were underwhelming. Starters were brought to the table and while they tasted good, the pace of refills needed to improve.

I honestly liked the veg biriyani and the schezwan fried rice from the main course. The stone ice cream in the desserts section was worth a mention and that's about it.

It's expensive factoring in the food and service you get. These guys need to pull up their socks if they want really survive in a competitive environment. Could give it a try for the ambiance though.",3,"107 Reviews , 634 Followers",5/11/2019 21:28,3,
Eat India Company,Sai Prasanth Nandagiri,"Have been to lunch with friends here today, first things, ambiance seems to be pretty good, i think people just carried on ambiance for this location. Serving is damn slow, even though not much of crowd in the restaurant. Price is pretty on a higher side, virgin mojito just tasted as mint lemon drink. We need to ask several times to serve, also when we for main course figured out that few dishes were not served to us which were part of starters, when asked, the same was brought later, Welcome Drink is the one which is served after several remainders and tasted bad. Desserts were not so great and not many. Felt with the cost that was paid this is not much upto mark. All in All pathetic service, you will literally ask 'n' number of times for food which is served on table. Not a wide range of dishes. Taste not so great especially with mock tails. Totally disappointed",2,"14 Reviews , 5 Followers",5/8/2019 17:15,0,
Eat India Company,Mounika,"Beautiful ambience. The vintage look took me back to some good old days. The food was okay but they take quite some time to bring in the order. For instance, 30 min for a glass of Coke? We had been here for dinner and it took us a while to figure out that both urban Asia and Eat India company are together. The staff didn't attend us for a long time. I gave the 3 star for the ambience and the experience I had with the people I went with.",3,"25 Reviews , 12 Followers",5/4/2019 14:01,0,

Drop in to this place with my partner for lunch,.They have zomato gold 1+1 food offer.. Ambiance is pretty authentic more like village and antique piece were drawing my attention....liked the quotes on pillars..
In starter, we ordered Kaju aur bhutte ki seekh which was too soft that break in small pieces.. Actually the consistency was not proper so could not take a bite properly.. Taste wise it was little bland so, there was only cashew taste I could feel..
In main course, we ordered Patiala Shahid paneer
Which was one of their signature dish which I was expecting to be good in taste..but again I disappointed with the taste it was normal onion tomato gravy and consistency of gravy was thin instead of creamy..Ajwain paratha and naan was good in taste

My experience was not so good..plus, staff members were not aware of anything regarding dish..",2,"151 Reviews , 2116 Followers",5/1/2019 15:45,5,
Eat India Company,Naimish Chandarana,"Instagram | veganyums_

Eat India company has a sharing kitchen with urban kitchen. Interestingly, in eat India company, they also gave the urban kitchen's menu. Ambience is pretty good that has cobination of modern furniture and ancient India decorum.

When we reach there, we asked waiter to suggest their best sellers in starters and main course. Very disappointed with the kind of knowledge they have about their dishes. They were not trained enough to speak confidently about the items mentioned in the menu.

Finally, we ordered kaju aur bhutte ki seekh in starter. The order arrived after 15 minutes. Plating looks good but tastewise, it was well below average. The stuffing was too dry, even with the chutney, it doesn't taste good.

In main course, we had patiala shahi paneer. Quantity was enough to serve two people, but again, don't expect the taste. Curry was too ordinary with lot of Curry leaves in it.

After having such a horrifying experience, they included 5% tips for their waiters. Think before you visit this place. And in any circumstance, if you are visiting, beware of this waiter tip and you have right to remove it from your bill.",2,"100 Reviews , 1224 Followers",4/27/2019 14:00,7,

We opted for a dinner buffet. The variety of items in the buffet were good. But starters were served cold on the table. This place is decently priced.

Eat India Company,Rohit Gupta,"#Disappointed

Went for dinner with friends. Was bit disappointed with the service and food. Firstly due to lack of space they have clubbed Urban Asia nd Eat India on the same floor. Which make service bit slow and confused.
We opted for buffet, here also they served fusion of both the restaurant. For example they served chicken sorba for non-veg and Khaw-Souy for veg.
It's simply confusing and making ur dinning experience not that great.",3,"120 Reviews , 790 Followers",2/10/2019 11:46,0,
Eat India Company,Rohit Rao,"Eat India Company (EIC). So this is a very interesting place. You go there, and first impressions very good. When you are seated, you get 3 menu cards, 4 actually. Besides EIC, you are also given the menu of Urban Asia and Tiki Shack. It's all in one place. Now dont be surprised if you go there to have in Urban Asia and are given all three menu cards. HAHA!

Ok. So there was buffet at the EIC. I scanned thru it and they had very good options. There were number of options. Very intriguing. Though i had √Ä la cart. 

Ambience is very good. You want to go and see whats on every wall, it's interesting. Lighting is good, you get to see what you are eating (i've seen some dont have enough lighting. Not talking about Dialogue in the dark here, hehe). 

Taste was good, as in ok. I've tasted better biryanis at other places. All and all it was a good experience. Nothing like WOW or Very different. It's a good place, your regular go out and have good food.",4,"54 Reviews , 71 Followers",2/1/2019 5:58,7,
Eat India Company,Roy Burmon,"The place gets its name probably from EAST INDIA COMPANY and they have maintained a quite good vintage ambience in there.
Though the prices are in a bit higher end, but thats something you can expect from a brand like URBAN ASIA.

Now talking about the food, the varieties offered in both veg and nonveg is quite good and delicious. They take there their time to get the food, but thats because they cook it hot right after the order is placed.

Overall a good place for family as well as to hangout with friends.",5,"17 Reviews , 25 Followers",1/18/2019 9:28,0,

Eat India Company,Abhishek Singh,"I have been to Eat India Company twice. To Sum up my experience, I found the service Sloppy and mindless. Food has fluctuating standards here, for a meal that cost almost 2k for 2 people without drinks one would expect at least some good to come out of the most basic cuisines. 
The kadhai paneer which should have been lip smacking and flavourful was totally bland.
The service was so lethargic that I had to wait almost 30 minutes for my food on a day when only 3-4 tables were booked.
The only positive side of this place is the ambiance which is great, authentic artifacts from the past add a good aurora but the place needs to step up its game in terms of food that they offer.

P.S. I was pretty excited about going to this place but unfortunately my experience was so bad that I shall never visit this one again.",2,"8 Reviews , 128 Followers",12/21/2018 5:41,0,

There is absolutely nothing to dine even at chinese side. Dessert section is something you will not feel to have it. You will immediately goto icecream counter where you will wait for 20-30 min and finally that fellow will state we dont have that flavour and can only give butterscotch. Its not that it got over by the time ur turn came, it was never there and they made u wait n finally forcing u to have wht he prepared than wht u want. Finally you will end up paying such huge bucks for drinking water and go straight to office to do lunch at your own office canteen which will look so beautiful than ever before.

Paneer lababdar 3.5/5 - taste was quite different and paneer was fresh. The tangy taste was dominating and not all may like it.

Tandoor roti 3/5 - was hard.

Lemongrass and mint ice cream 2.5/5- I expected a single serve of ice cream with a mix of these 2 flavors, but I was served with these two separately. Mint ice cream was too strong and we didn't like it, lemongrass was avg.

AMBIENCE 4/5 - decent ambience for a family dining..

SERVICE 2/5 - extremely slow. Had to remind 2-3 times to get our order. This definitely has to be improvised.",3,"61 Reviews , 262 Followers",9/25/2018 22:10,0,
Eat India Company,Aarti Passi,"Decent Ambience with light music. Taste of food - Not that great, No much Varieties in buffet. In all, it is not worth the money spent.
They really need to keep more varieties.
No salads.
only 3 desserts including ice cream.
So, it was an average experience",3,"8 Reviews , 4 Followers",9/24/2018 23:20,0,
Eat India Company,Sachin Varshney,"On my special day (BDay), I had been there. Overall it was a great dining experience. Courteous staff was the strong point here. We took a special dinner buffet. 4/5 starters served was delicious. Less option in main course and dessert though. Would like to visit here again. :)",4,1 Review,9/22/2018 14:48,0,
Eat India Company,Trisha Chakraborty,Late review. Ambiance is good(theme : ancient India with various stuffs).

Eat India Company,Adheeth Hundi,"Being a foodie and going for a buffet is like craving for a lump sum treat!
But the restaurant has disappointed.
1. Ambience and service was great.
2. We went for buffet , firstly the starters weren't that good at taste. Common panner kebab type of starter, corn , chicken, veg kebab. Well none o them weren't good as having them twice.
3. Main course was a disaster, very few choices that too of rare vegetables and less eaten. No panner the main dish, rice items weren't good. Skipped and went to the desert section.
4. Desserts was like stabbing a dead man. Nothing exciting, only the ice cream was good.

Overall, it is expensive and less satisfying. If you are hungry and looking for a buffet please skip this one.",3,"7 Reviews , 12 Followers",9/16/2018 21:43,0,
Eat India Company,Ankit Mohanty,This place served the worst Indian food I could ever ask for in Hyderabad. The towels were dirty and not properly washed. The food was just horrible. Loud music from the pub above will spoil your dining experience even more and when I asked for outdoor seating they lied saying it's only a smokin' area. Not visiting this place ever again. An extra star only coz of the interior otherwise this place is just worthy of a 1 star.,2,"33 Reviews , 269 Followers",9/15/2018 8:34,1,

We tried out their buffet.
Food was decent. Liked the starters, and the main course menu. Thai green curry was impressive.
Service was a little slow.

Eat India Company,Varun MotawalA,"Pathetic!!! A group of 20 people from work visited this place, we didn't have great expectations, at the same time we didn't foresee a terrible experience that it eventually would turn out to be. Half of us were seated close to the glass facing the Gachibowli road, thanks to their incredible maintenance, the ac was so poor, we were all sweating profusely. We weren't served starters for atleast 40 minutes. The choice of plates and their maintenance is extremely poor to say the least. The food (starters, main course, desserts) tasted so bad that most of us were content just eating curd and ice cream. We will never be going back to this place.",1,"25 Reviews , 7 Followers",9/13/2018 1:16,0,

Eat India Company,Vedant Killa,"A group of 4, we decided to visit this place on Saturday evening. The location is quite on the main road, however, the parking and the entry is terrible. They can surely improve in this aspect as it can be a big turn-off.ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

After entering the restaurant, we were quite impressed with the ambience and the decor. It had a very India taste to it. They had old locks, keys, doors and other wooden stuff adding to the rustic look. üòç

Coming to the food, there is a plethora of options on their menu. Instead of going through it all, we decided to quickly take recommendations and order it with the bearer. Hariyali Paneer Tikka and Corn cubes made for the perfect starter combination. Corn cubes cannot be missed here. My friend ordered a Chicken starter which was quite average though. Moving to main course, we wanted to keep it simple with rotis and a few curries. Paneer Lababdar, Mushroom curry and Nizami Handi seemed like good choices. Food was decent.

The service was not impeccable. It ca surely be improved. Also, they did not even serve finger bowls at the end of our meal. Quite a surprise. üòë

The price point is a little on the higher side- probably much more than average. üòÖüòÖ It can be a great negative. They accepted gold on food, so yay!

Overall, a good experience, but probably not one worth visiting again.",3,"86 Reviews , 216 Followers",9/9/2018 22:56,2,

The antique royal doors, old locks and vintage pictures hanging on the wall and ceiling added to the charm. Quality and quantity is almost worth the price.

Eat India Company,Amul Chittalkar,"If you‚Äôre wondering what to do on Sunday then head to Eat India Company, Gachibowli. Eat India Company has been one of my favorite restaurants in Hyderabad since years. Now they‚Äôve opened a new branch in Gachibowli. Yay to all my office folks. Everything from the ambience to the d√©cor, to the music is wonderful. The quality and taste of the food over the years has been consistent. I love love love Indian food and they have some delicious dishes if you‚Äôre a meat lover. Everything from shorba to kebabs to nalli ki nihari to dum biryani is sooooooo yum!

On Sundays, the branch at Gachibowli teams up with Urban Asia to host a special brunch from 12 pm to 3 pm. Urban Asia is another brilliant kitchen for Asian food. If you love Chinese and Indian food, you cannot miss this brunch. They have more than 27 dishes with veg and non-veg options plus desserts. Apart from this, they also had chaat and sushi as well when I went. All this at 888 per person only. What a steal deal. My favorite five dishes from the menu are hara bara kebab, chicken angara, kang pao fish, mutton rogan josh and of course the Dal Bukhara [for those of you who don‚Äôt know, this is a velvety makhani style dal that is not spicy but packed with flavor].

Make sure to book your table in advance. Another good tip in case you‚Äôre someone who wakes up late or you forget to book a table is to go after 2pm cause it‚Äôs usually not crowded at that time. Let me know how you like it! Thank me later.",5,"23 Reviews , 61 Followers",9/6/2018 12:07,0,

Eat India Company,Akshay Krishna,"It was supposed to be a really casual lunch and we didn‚Äôt expect this place to be nice but were surprised for sure.

So it‚Äôs a nice restaurant with well arranged furniture and light. Has a buffet lunch which is very convenient for Software professionals and casual lunches with friends.

I have small complaints which are listed in the end but apart from that I had a nice time.

So in the spread, something that I loved dearly was the Chilly Prawns. I just couldn‚Äôt get enough of it. It was amazing.
The chicken was alright. But I can say but prawns were the best. Although they were really small, but can‚Äôt complain much. They didn‚Äôt give us fish even after we asked for it.

Staff: attentive and service was okay.

Ambience: very nice place, looks good, clean, effort was put in to make it look nice.

Food: food was definitely good I liked it quite a lot apart from the desserts. They were pretty bad.

Complaints: Starting with the ice cream guy- they have a cold stone ice cream. He broke a water glass on the bar counter while making ice cream (technically just mixing it) and he used his already worn gloves and ice cream scoop to push the glass pieces away. Didn‚Äôt wash his hands or change his gloves or wash his scoop. For all we know the glass pieces were still on his hands and scoop.

Second is also with the ice cream guy, we found hair inside the ice cream he made us and returned it immediately. Lost our appetite soon after that.

Third is with one of the waiters, probably didn‚Äôt want to give us fish even after we asked him to get us some which was on the buffet menu. He agreed to get some but never showed up with it. I hope it‚Äôs his memory and nothing else that caused the problem.

Hopefully management reads this and takes action on it.

If those factors are avoided, then will go again definitely.",3,"144 Reviews , 911 Followers",8/24/2018 22:25,0,
