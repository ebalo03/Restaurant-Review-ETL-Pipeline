Hitech Bawarchi Food Zone,Srikanth Kuramana,I ordered a chicken biryani at a cost 120rs which is an affordable price to have food for one person. But in this restaurant immediately when the order came I am really frustrated to see the quantity and quality. First talking about quantity it doesn't satisfy the hunger of atleast one person and then talking about quality it was not served hot . Readily packed food and looks like as it was not cooked fresh may be cooked atleast a day before I guess. I suggest my friends and colleagues never select this restaurant and I'll never order from this restaurant. I am even wondered how come this restaurant get 2.6 rating which is too high. Waste of money and time going to this restaurant and ordering from this restaurant.,1,1 Review,11/20/2018 0:56,0,

I ordered Chicken Dum Biryani from one of the outlet of Hitech Bawarchi online. It was a single serve biryani containing a single large chicken piece. Biryani was fully loaded with dum and basmati rice was used. The quantity of biryani was more than sufficient for a single person. Along with biryani, salad, Salan and Raita was served. Biryani was packed in a good plastic container and carried in Hitech Bawarchi carry bag.",3,"104 Reviews , 334 Followers",9/30/2018 15:41,0,
