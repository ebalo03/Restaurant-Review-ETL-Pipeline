Karachi Cafe,Sidharth Mittal,"Pizza didn't taste anything like a pizza. Stale broccoli, don't know what kind of sauce they used for it. Atleast it was hot and well cooked. Won't ever order a pizza again from here.",3,"62 Reviews , 119 Followers",5/23/2019 3:21,0,

Karachi Cafe,Vignesh Rk,"This place has a really aesthetic ambiance starting from the vintage design to the 60-70s music that plays in the background.
We ordered the famous Irani chai with a bunch of onion samosa, fries and a pasta sandwich.

This place serves one of the best Irani Chai that i have had in hyderabad. The onion samosa takes me back to my childhood days when we used to buy them at small shops for a rupee or so. They tasted amazing here. I wouldn't recommend getting the chai ir samosa delivered at all. Kills the taste completely. These needs to be had hot and getting it delivered will definitely disappoint.

Talking about the fries, i wouldn't say they were amazing but they sure weren't bad. We did not like the Pasta sandwich. This item wouldn't be something that i would recommend.

This place would remain one of my favorite spots to hangout at.

Karachi Cafe,Akash Pingley,"One of the worst services I would have ever come across. There were two incidents at the same cafe and the feedback given to them was not even reviewed.
The first time, I ordered an Irani Chai and it took them 1hour to serve and it was one first chais ever consumed. It was served in a broken glass. Very disappointed.

The second time, my female friend wanted to use the washroom but it was extremely dirty and smelling.


It‚Äôs sad to see such disappointment from a brand like Karachi.",2,"22 Reviews , 90 Followers",5/3/2019 10:39,0,
Karachi Cafe,Andleeb Zaidi,"Want good back grounds for a retro themed photoshoot and while you‚Äôre at it , munch on some delicious food? Karachi Cafe , Gachibowli is THE place for you!
Food:
‚Ä¢Peri peri chicken- This dish includes chicken breast topped with peri peri sauce ,is served with mashed potatoes ,Garlic bread and saut√©ed vegetables.
The chicken was properly marinated and cooked to perfection with the tenderness still intact, it was already sliced to bite sized pieces.
‚Ä¢Chicken pesto sandwich- The sandwiches have a filling of chicken marinated in pesto sauce along with cucumbers and tomatoes; served with potato wedges and tomato ketchup. It has very light taste and perfect meal for two on Hot summer day.
‚Ä¢Bun Maska- Literally the best BUNS you could get your hands on! Filled with fresh cream, melted butter and a layer of white sugar, it‚Äôs literally addictive!

Beverages:
‚Ä¢Cold coffee- The beverage wasn‚Äôt cold or strong enough to be called as cold coffee in the first place. Would not recommend this drink.
‚Ä¢Irani chai- generally Irani chai is suppose to be milky and sweet but this wasn‚Äôt very sugary. It had a mild yet tempting taste . Would definitely recommend.

Ambience: Every wall is decorated with vintage posters, articles and artwork, the front panel of the cafe is made of glass which gives a beautiful glowing effect to the space and the green plants add to its beauty. Perfect place for a formal meeting or a casual hangout with friends or family.",4,"1 Review , 4 Followers",4/29/2019 23:16,5,

Ambiance of cafe is very nice, full of old stuff, photographs and plants as well.
U can also put the plant on your table.
Food is good and quantity is more than enough.

Location: Near chocolate room,old Bombay highway,Gachibowli
Been here for an hour and my observations went like the below.

Had a Bombay Roasted sandwich and Dum Ki chai.
Bombay Roasted sandwich
Price:INR 150
TASTE:4.5/5
Dum ki chai
Price: INR 55
Taste:4.5/5
The sandwich gave me a classic Bombay vadapav taste and was baked and roasted well.
The dum ki chai was to the next level of Irani Chai and ultimately said to be well

Karachi Cafe,Shalini Mukherjee,"Been to this place a few months back. I must say, it has a very aesthetically pleasing decor. Both indoor and outdoor seating arrangement is available. It is also pretty easy to locate.

The items we ordered were Barbeque Mushroom Sandwich, Spaghetti in Alfredo sauce with Vegetables, Apple Pie with Vanilla Ice cream, Irani Chai and Filter Kapi. Apart from the apple pie, all the items were really tasty. The pie's crust was a bit too thick. Rest, everything was worth every single penny. I would love to visit this place again.

Quantity: 4.5/5

Value for money: 4.5/5

I also happened to order their Exotic Vegetable Pizza through Zomato. I found the price quite reasonable. The best part was the sauce with a desi twist.

Karachi Cafe,Shubham Billus,"Man! Who the hell are giving such high ratings to such useless cafes? Yesterday I went to one cafe seeing a 4+ zomato rating, and it was horrible. Today I went here and it even exceeded that other cafe today in terms of pure pathetic-ness of the cafe. The service is so rude, slow and pathetic that you wonder how bad would it be to make it self service. The food is bad and certainly not worth such high prices. And the guys are least bothered to tell you by the time that you ask for bill that one of the drinks you ordered isn't available; let alone bring drinks along with the food. I don't know how these inflated ratings in Hyderabad is working, but in my hometown, a place like this would hardly touch 2 stars rating on zomato.",1,3 Reviews,3/2/2019 21:49,0,
Karachi Cafe,Anjanaa Karthik,"I really wish i could finish off the review in a word, but yeah, zomato is not letting me to that! If you guys want to have irani chai, i guess this is the place. And omg, that onion samosa? Before getting there, do you guys remember the small triangle shaped samosa we would all go ga-ga for? Yes. They have it! You don't need to go street to street searching for them. They have it right here. So one plate samosa, irani chai and osmania biscuits. You hit cloud nine! Oh i forgot, this is for you guys! To the guys who are living alone far away from your own home without your mamma and pappa, you'd definitely wanna hit this place listening to 'mere sapno ke rani kab..'. yea. Only Kishore Kumar !

I usually do not eat mutton dishes in restaurants (I prefer home-made), but the Keema Pav served here reminded me of home - it's that good! We had even ordered for Baida Roti - which was again too good and had a very interesting take to it. (By the way, their servings are quite big compared to what they charge you for!) Suleimaani Chaai also deserves a special mention, it was so good that we ordered it twice.

Karachi Cafe,Anupam Agarwal,"Looking for a nice evening Chai and something to go with it , this can be one really good option. Located in Gachibowli just off the main raod it's a nice small cafe.

The interiors give you a feeling of a hangout place for the millennials , to just come, sit, relax , have tea and just engage in hearty conversation. If you have a office in Financial District one can take out probably an hour and can visit the place.

I would definitely recommend some of the items
Tea - I am a tea lover and hence can never get over this
Keema Pav - good
Irani onion samosa - definitely recommend
Bun Maska - dip it in tea and enjoy

Overall a nice place can be visited at leasure

Karachi Cafe,Moonis Ahmed,"The visit to this place was something on my mind for a long time. This was rated highly on Zomato and was recommended by a number of my contacts, so decided to give it a shot on a Friday night with the 'homeminister'. 
We came in late but the place was still lively. On entering, you definitely notice the ambiance which is a bit idyllic and retro. With the 70s and the 80s song playing in the background, you definitely feel like going back in some time. 

We settled in and ordered fries, keema pav, and chicken farcha. To gulp it all down we ordered the Irani chai. 

Boy o boy we were in for a treat. All the dishes were simply delicious and mouthwatering. Their keema pav is true to its name and fame, amazing. The chicken farcha was crispy on the outside and juicy inside. All the dishes were served piping hot which enhanced the taste.

Service was a bit slow but it could be understood as the meals were served hot. Though the place is small, it can comfortably sit a good amount of people with seating outside as well. Slightly on the pricier side, we still felt it was worth it given the quantity. With the trusted name of Karachi sweets as the backers, you can definitely count on the quality.

Karachi Cafe,Tamal Sarkar,"Starting off I was amazed by the looks and ambience of the place from the side of the road ! So I was anticipating it !

On a sunny Sunday morning I convinced my friends to come down here !

The ambience and the themed decorations was fascinating and how they maintained it so well and beautifully
The kettle shaped water jug and the bulb shaped salt containers the rough and old furniture look and the old Bollywood movie dialogue and old popular brands ! All of it put together was so so appealing to me !
The old big radio and the dial up Telephones brought back so many childhood memories !

Coming to what we ordered

BBQ chicken Sub
Chicken 65 Sub
Omlette Sandwich
Crispy Chicken burgers
Apple pie with Vanilla ice cream

The first thing that as lovely about each of these(except Apple pie of course) that they were whole some and there were generous amount of French fries t and wedges to go along with the mains !

I had the burger and it was damn fulfilling
Crispy square chicken patties and layered with veggies and lettuce, it was really nice! however to be critical it could have done with more cheese or mayonnaise !

The Subs were spicy and had substantial chicken pieces and the omlette Sandwich was pretty decent too !
Overall I felt the pocket pinch was quite normal for a cafe ! At least the food satisfied our appetite !

P.S. - They took their theme very seriously and that shows when you enter the washroom !
You'll find a old Rexona ad in a frame !

All in all the place seemed perfect for all occasions for a romantic date or getaway
For a group outing for people who love Ambience and for random tea meet ups as well !

Karachi Cafe,HyderabadiGluttons,"The perfect place to spend a rainy afternoon with your loved one. This retro Cafe will rewind you back to the 70s. Ambience is the USP of this cozy little cafe. Old classics playing in the background would soothe you with nostalgia.

We settled for an Irani Chai coupled with Mawa cake. While the tea was top notch, the cake was just about average. Service is very good.

Overall, one of those places where ambience can pull you again and again",3,"2 Reviews , 1 Follower",9/5/2018 20:22,1,

Karachi Cafe,Nupur Rani,"A cafe by the legendary Karachi Bakery,it lives upto the name. The ambience literally transports you to old times with posters from old brands and smallest of details taken care of. Like the television and telephone from the old times that no one uses now are a part of the decor. Service is also good with prompt and courteous staff. Food presentation is good and taste wise, can't say much as we only tried the Irani chai (which was really good). Overall, a really good experience.",4,"70 Reviews , 173 Followers",9/3/2018 12:29,1,

Karachi Cafe,Jalaj Goyal,"It was a payday and was looking for pocket friendly restaurant in Indira Nagar area when we encountered Karachi Cafe!! As you enter the restaurant you time travel to 80s-90s era. The wall paint, bit rugged, and the walls decorated with movie posters and advertisements of the bygone era. To submerge you in that majestic generation they have kept a black and white television set, radio and a landline with round dialling pad, milk cans, kettle, glass jars, and of course the attire of the waiters!! The old melodies make you just go wow!!

Coming to the food, we ordered Chicken Kabiraji and Macaroni Pink Grilled Chicken Pasta!!
Let's discuss each in an order.

Chicken Kabiraji was so tender and delectable that you will just forget about the surroundings and will just relish the flavour of kasundi with the awesomely fried cutlets dipped in beaten egg!!!

Next delicacy, Macaroni Pink Grilled Chicken Pasta. Remotely similar taste of pasta which I experienced was a long time back. The blend of red and white sauce will leave you speechless. The quantity was great for two.

I would suggest to visit this place with good hopes and do try other items on the list!!

The cafe has a brilliant old school charm, which will take you back in time. Posters of old films and redundant brands are all over the walls of this cafe.
This place serves the best irani chai, period. The mawa cake was decent too. Osmania biscuits, as usual tasted brilliant.

Karachi Cafe,Vinay Srivastava,"This place is as perfect as a cafe can be. It's beautiful, soothing, and calms you down.
The ambiance, walls, furniture is all old fashioned, would remind you of the old Parsi cafes in Goa or Bombay. They play old Bollywood music of 1970s, which blends perfectly with the mood. The staff is extremely courteous.
We were two of us, and we ordered so much. Irani chai, Bombay khari, fruit nankhatai, maska bun, keema pav, rice-Veg-khuchamber raita combo, and a sweet lime juice. Everything tastes delicious!
The portions are limited, and the prices are a bit on the higher side, but all in all it's totally worth it. This is going to be my 'go to place' in the city from now on.",5,"68 Reviews , 185 Followers",8/10/2018 12:18,5,

The service and the taste of the food both were decent and nothing to complain of.

If you love savouring snacks from the old City with a cup of tea, this is the place to be. Though there are places which give you a better taste for the same things in the menu, they don't offer the ambience of this cafe.
