Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Ashwi Sharma,"Haleem, the best place to try out.

Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Mikhail Wadhwani,Used to hear that this was probably the best place to have haleem in the city. To my dismay I ordered their renowned haleem last night at about 12PM. Tastewise it seemed average but as I was hungry I finished it fast. Fell asleep at 2AM to wake up at 5AM with a severe upset stomach. This went on and when I woke up by 10AM my stomach still hurt. I'm pretty sure it was some form of mild food poisoning maybe due to hygiene  standards. Nonetheless if they keep this up they'll gradually lose their clientele. Would recommend a place called Cafe 555. Their haleem is far tastier and doesn't come with the complimentary food poisoning.,5,"22 Reviews , 171 Followers",5/22/2019 19:07,0,

Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Siddharth B.,"Always the best... The taste of the biryani is so unique that I can close my eyes, taste the biryani and tell that it's Shah Ghouse Biryani....

I deducted one point for the behaviour, which could have been better. Not pointing towards any specific scenario but I would prefer ordering online from Shah Ghouse than going there and eating, specially when I am late.

The quality sets it apart from its competition. It is guaranteed that you will get the same excellent quality of food everytime ...

I judge a restaurant by its consistency and Shah Ghouse is indeed the most consistent restaurant in terms of food quality.",4,"31 Reviews , 82 Followers",5/19/2019 14:16,0,

Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Mohammad Imtiaz Alam Taj,"I have ordered multiple times from this restaurant and I have never been so upset. Of course I have recieved wrong orders from this place once or twice before which I ignored and not reported thinking these might be human errors but its beyond those now. Orders can't go wrong so many times when you have such a full fledged food business across the city. Yet another incident today where my order was wrong. You can check with my name what I ordered and find the attached picture of what you sent in my very recent order which was on 7th May'19.

Hope you people learn from your mistakes and yes I wouls also like to bring it to notice that the zomato support is no good either. They deny support right on your face which is unprofessional and unethical both at the same time. Guess Zomato needs to upgrade their standards and teach their support reps about what customer service is about and how to do it right.",1,"1 Review , 2 Followers",5/8/2019 2:35,1,

I suggest everyone not to order any food from this restaurant(Shah ghouse gachibowli)

Though the restaurant claims to be authentic original Hyderabadi taste the Gachibowli branch was open in 2015. Given that the ambiance and maintenance is pathetic. It looks and feel extremely unhygienic to the point that we had second thoughts eating there. Staff was extremely disorganized and there were many customers seen complaining.
So for ambiance and hygiene it's a complete NO...
Food was okay we ordered Apollo fish starter which was very hard. And spcl mutton biryani which was good but nothing exceptional and Paradise or Pista house has better taste than it. Quantity wise it was sufficient for both of us. And it was pocket friendly hence 2 ratings.

Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,DieEating,"To sum it up - ""Amazingly Delicious"".

We ordered the enormous Tandoori Family Platter, fresh Apollo fish and the massive ""Jumbo Pack"" Biryani.

Tandoori Family Platter (hand for scale) - This beast consist of 5 whole chickens (different kebabs), boti kebabs and seekh kebabs ... Served with 8 rumali rotis
and
Apollo Fish (The plate in top middle which is not so small but looks tiny in front of the platter)

Jumbo Pack Biryani - This delicious biryani is the one to die for. Arguably, one of the best Hyderabadi Biryani, it is served with Egg curry & raita and can easily feed an entire family.

Price:
Tandoori Family Platter: Rs. 1300/-
Apollo Fish: Rs. 240/-
Jumbo Pack Biryani: Rs.600/-

Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Arpa Ghosh,"Visited this place on 24 March,2019, as one of my friend invited us to have a lunch party there. We went there around 1 pm and it was pretty difficult to get a car parking there, but we managed one. Not to mention that the place was literally overcrowded! Such is popularity of this place! Lets find out, how the experience was.

Ambiance

=========

Its a multistoried restaurant. And every floor was full to the brim, with several Biriyani crazy people! We got seated at the second floor. The floor was brimming with people and hardly any empty table. The seats were well laid out , comfy and spacious. Ratings - 3.5/5.

Service

=========

The waiter took some time to take the order and quite some time to deliver the food. He paid heed to whatever requests we made and was keen to help. Overall service was fine. Ratings - 4/5.

Food

=========

Here comes the big deal. Lets find out if all the craze that this place generates, is worth it? Actually four of us were there for the lunch and the waiter recommended ""Family Pack"" chicken Biriyani along with Reshmi Kebab and Ginger chicken for starters. The starters arrived and they looked yum! The Reshmi Kebab was wrapped in an fluffy wrapping (made with the non-yolk part of the egg) . The kebabs were so soft that it literally melted in our mouth. The ginger chicken was tasty as well. Must mention that both the starters had ample amount of chicken pieces, which was pretty filling for even four of us. Then came the ""Family Pack"" Biriyani, which was more than enough for even four of us( we even had to parcel the leftover). The Biriyani, here has a very different taste here. Its not that spicy but its delicious! No wonder, this place is so famous! Ratings - 4.5/5.

Value for Money

============

All these food, for just thousand bucks! Need I say more. Pisa Vasool. Ratings - 5/5.

Lets calculate,

Rating = (Ambiance + Service + Food + VFM)/4 = 4.25

Final Thoughts

=============

If you are in Hyderabad and looking for Biriyani experience ( also soft and yummy kebabs), then visit to this place is an absolute must! Highly Recommended!",4,"32 Reviews , 70 Followers",3/30/2019 11:09,3,

Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Rag,Our regular place to have chicken/mutton biryani. The flavour is awesome. Can't get the same anywhere. Most favourite is special chicken biryani. The biryani will be completely different compared to the regular restaurants style.,5,4 Reviews,3/26/2019 19:53,0,

Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Bhatnagar Benni Korani,"Please don't visit this place in the night if at all you are going along with your family...
No service after 12:00 as the zomato says it's open upto 2:00...complete missguiding and fooling customers....
I'm a fan of the biryani served here...but the staff,the timings,and the cleanliness over here is a clean bullshit...
Better to visit the other branches like shalibanda and tolichowli...please don't visit this holy hell....!
I posted some pics just look at the table where we dine to eat...yuck...!",1,"1 Review , 4 Followers",3/24/2019 1:06,0,

Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Nitin Bhapkar,"Most disappointing experience ever! Ordered for vegetable biryani during midnight hours from this restaurant. Delivery through swiggy was quick and swift but to my surprise I received only biryani rice, absolute no vegetables or masala. Very bland taste too. I do not understand why these restaurants cheats customers if they out of stock. I would not recommend anyone to trust this restaurant",1,"15 Reviews , 94 Followers",3/23/2019 1:05,1,

Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Bhawana Bahuguna,"I had heard a lot about this place so I went there. The dining area was pretty jammed and there seemed a lot of dirt lying around like used napkins, food etc. I anyway passed it for the fact that the place is all time busy. But then I saw a RAT nibbling on the scattered food. I reported this to the manager and he told me it's okay and 'ek do Galti toh ho jati hai' and they literally forced me to pay for my order which I did not even touch. The staff was highly rude and it has been one of the worst experiences in Hyderabad.",1,1 Review,3/17/2019 16:05,0,

Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Satyajit Behera,"The hotel never updates the status of the order. I called Zomato support after 20 mins of placing the order, then the Zomato support team calls the hotel to accept the order and then they update the order. Next them mention it will be delivered by 1:11pm but again no update. I called again at 1:15pm to check what happened to the order. They again called the hotel to get an update. Then they mention your food is still getting prepared, its in the kitchen. What the hell the order that should have delivered way back its still in kitchen and you guys don't mind to update or apologize. I asked to cancel the order and Zomato said it can't cancel as it will be waste of food. Great and I am stuck with the hotel's will to deliver it or not. Pathetic service.",1,1 Review,3/15/2019 13:33,0,

Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Deepthikalakshmi Akkina,"Went for team lunch on friday, overcrowded and hard to get the place. After 30 minutes of waiting got the table. Ordered tandoori platter and dum Biryani.

Chicken Tandoori is roasted and spices are marinated well and biryani is worth for waiting. Remaining items are better to ignore ( Roti and kebabs)

Dessert - kurbani ka meta is delicious.

Pros: Budget friendly

Cos: long waiting especially on weekends
