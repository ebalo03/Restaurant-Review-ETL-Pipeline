Tiki Shack,Anshul Gupta,"A very bad experience. I went here with my team, but the staff made sure that we had the worst experience. The food was cold, served very late. Drinks were of bad quality. Staff behavior was also very bad.",1,"2 Reviews , 3 Followers",5/25/2019 16:58,0,
Tiki Shack,Anshul Gupta,"Everything since I entered the restaurant was a disaster. I received cold food after 45 minutes after I placed the order, that too after multiple complaints. The drinks quality was not good. It happened twice that the staff forgot the order after we placed it. They had to be reminded about the order. Overall very bad experience regarding food quality, drinks quality and service. Would not recommend to visit.",1,"9 Reviews , 78 Followers",5/25/2019 16:55,0,

Tiki Shack,Gautam Narang,"We came at this restaurant for a drink on a weekday at it didn‚Äôt disappoint. Music was good. We ordered a Pizza, Garlic Bread and Beers. Pizza was the best I‚Äôve ever had, but Garlic Bread was disappointing. Also, we had a couple of Beers and we ordered a couple more. They were unopened, we changed our mind and asked the waiter to exchange them with Coke which was refused. I didn‚Äôt understand the waiter‚Äôs logic and I didn‚Äôt argue. Also, apart from Beer everything is costly here. I‚Äôm going for a 3 out 5 for this restaurant.
PS: This restaurant serves the best Pizza in Hyderabad.",3,"16 Reviews , 82 Followers",5/24/2019 14:49,1,

Tiki Shack,Jasmin,"Last night spent at Tiki Shack for a quick round of drinks. As we reached it started raining giving some respite from the heat and we could enjoy the lovely terrace ambience.

Watermelon martini for me and Bacardi for my better half with some pork spare ribs was our order. Martini was well made to my liking. The ribs had only one rib and rest were chunky pieces which we pointed out. But it was well made in spicy siracha sauce which kind of compensated.

Overall a nice place with ample seating though music is on the louder side. The only let down was the plastic cutlery which you wouldn't expect here.",4,"120 Reviews , 562 Followers",5/21/2019 12:26,0,

Tiki Shack,Prithvikvn20,everything about this place sound good .. with great ambiance and decent food and drink options .. I would recommend this place only if you are going as a couple or girls .. they have a huge gender discrimination for guys as they need to pay higher cover charges on weekends than the bill they would sum up .. world and tikki shack will be a better place if they stop discriminations and spread equality,2,3 Reviews,5/18/2019 23:14,0,

Tiki Shack,Mr. Ego,"The desi pub with the beach theme. They have both the indoor and outdoor seating. But they usually provide only the outdoor seating, as they keep their indoor seating mostly reserved. You might reserve and still end up sitting outside. The food was also good. The customer service is something that needs to be improved.
Top picks :
Chilly Prawns
Cheesy Fries

The chilly prawns is a must try. The mocktails were okay. Not much varieties when it comes to mocktails. Overall, a great place to hangout.",4,"57 Reviews , 513 Followers",5/17/2019 0:17,8,
Tiki Shack,Praveen Kumar Rai,"Ambience and location is nice. But nice to hangouts only in group and a girl is mandatory to be in group. Else entry will be denied. Thumbs down for stag. Starters are good but main course is really horrible. Very small portion of drinks specially when they see you are busy in chatting or talking. The staff is polite but you have to chase them multiple times for taking orders. You can have opt for this only when all other nearby places are full. The complete street is full of restaurants and can be given priority.
You might see lot of positive feedbacks but most of them are done just to get a free ice cream. Yes, they offer free ice cream if you write good reviews for them. Luckily I don't like vanilla flavour so will write what I felt.",2,"2 Reviews , 2 Followers",5/16/2019 19:30,0,

The service at this place is pathetic , we had to call the waiters several time for one small thing also .
It was a pub with no dance floor, people had to manage with whatever place they were getting
The place is known for its beach view but as we went on weekday could not see that
Food- ofcourse no one should expect anything with the food we get in pubs , it was not good here as well

Tiki Shack,Manisha Panda,I had been with a friend on a weekday when the place was not much crowded. All we had are pizzas and drinks. The best part is you can customize your pizza.

Tiki Shack,Asha JS,"This one is bigger than the Jubilee hills one and surely got good space which is a great thing as the previous one gets so cringy. We went on a ladies night but the sad part it goes only from 8 to 10 p.m. and most of the girls where not even there, anyway the starters are quite price competitive and tasty. We had veg spring rolls, veg manchurian and chicken balls. All were great and I have ordered Long Island Iced tea which they made perfect.

On Wednesdays they have a guest DJ Maddy who plays super awesome tracks and in house DJ Akso is great too.

All the best guys.....keep rocking üëç

Tiki Shack,Amlan Jena,"Looking for a place filled with crazy people with affordable drinks and upbeat music? Tiki Shack is the place for you. Located on roof top in Indra Nagar , you get a good view of tall office buildings that have crowded Gachibowlli and Hi-Tech City. The place is dimly lit, but I guess that is on purpose to set up the mood and if you are a party animal you are most surely going to get engrossed by the music in no time. The DJ plays all the trending tunes and it is sure to make you sway. The staff is courteous and prompt , despite the high density of crowd that gathers here during weekends. The food is quite affordable and also appeals to the taste buds at the same time. I have visited this place 3-4 times and have never been disappointed. Go in with your friends on a weekend for an affordable menu and feet tapping music.

Tiki Shack,The Other Foodie,"Visited the Gachibowli branch of Tiki Shak on a Sunday evening.
The place is very well placed in a very accessible area of Gachibowli.
It's a rooftop bar, hence the ambience was pretty amazing. They have Nicely set up indoor and outdoor seating areas.

We ordered :

Jalapeno Cheese poppers - 4/5 - Yummy cheese filled balls with right amount of spices and jalapenos.

Aloo Pakode - 3.5/5 - Pretty normal with a homely taste to it

Overall it was a good experience. The place also offers 2+2 on drinks which can also be used on mocktails ( Just in case you are not a fan of alcohol ).",4,"22 Reviews , 90 Followers",4/22/2019 1:11,4,

Tiki Shack,Sam,"We visited the place on Thursday night after calling up to do the booking for 3 stag entry. We got the response over the phone that we can just walk in at 7pm. As soon as I entered the first response from a person (Nikhil) at the front desk was ""Stag not allowed"". When I showed my phone and explained that I did call to do the booking, he said no. I was allowed after they realized that one of my other friends was already inside the pub and taken the table. It was so frustrating that treating someone so unprofessional and with a rude behavior. If you don't want to allow stag ...say it straight forward or put a notice outside so that no stag would even wish to enter. Don't change your rules according to your convenience. GROW UP !!!!!",1,1 Review,4/13/2019 7:10,0,

SHIT-FIT ‚Äì So Happy Its Thursday cuz Friday Is Tomorrow..!!

While we hit the weekend and everyone looking at places to hang out, I would like to share my recent experience with TiKi Shack - Rooftop Bar, Gachibowli where I have organized my team party which can serve you as a recommendation if still planning .. Such a pulsating d√©cor they got especially the blazing umbrella shaped roofing that sets the party vibe and takes you on. Their open rooftop gives a great evening view over food and drinks. This place can accommodate up to 200-300 pax (both sitting and standing crowd). Unlike many places around Gachibowli, Tikki Shack has got reasonable pricing (cost for 2 at 800-1000INR including alcohol) which answers the overcrowded weekends of this place. No Separate dance floor but the place opp to the bar counter turns out to be, after a while when the spirits go high.

We negotiated for a party package which needs a minimum of 20-25 pax to accommodate with at least 1 day prior notice/reservation priced at 1100 per person all-inclusive (has the flexibility to customise package and price depends accordingly). The menu includes Unlimited 3 Veg and Non-veg starters, 1 Veg and Non-Veg Pizza, 1 Veg and Non-Veg Biryani, 2 desserts, three varieties of mocktails (for teetotalers), draught beer/kingfisher ultra/premium (for people who drink). With least expectation, food esp starters turned out to be outstanding. Full house and the service was still attentive needs a special Mention.

Overall a satisfactory experience and I would highly recommend this place for all kinds of parties.

Kindly bare with the poor photography.

Tiki Shack,Vibhu Sharma,"I have been to this place twice. My first experience wasn't that great as I found the food items to be sub-par. So I quickly went to a different place. After 2 months I recently went again for an office party with ~40 people and it turned out to be a better experience. Starters [chilli chicken, fries, cheese poppers, some fish] were fine but nothing extra-ordinary, ambience was a bit crazy with random groups dancing here & there, DJ was average, Biryani was good I heard but did not try it myself. Pizza was a big let down both in taste & presentation, it was served cut into small rectangular pieces. Service was decent. Staff courteous. Good interiors.

Tiki Shack,Siddharth Gopalam,"I've been coming to this branch on a weekly basis. Off lately, like from 4 weeks or so, whenever I ask for the beer of my choice(KF Ultra or KF Draught), you guys just bluntly tell me that it's not available. Once, I've asked Karan directly and he told me that they'd be available only during the weekdays. I've visited this place today i.e. Wednesday and it's the same story, again! I'm forced to order Heineken or Bira. The worst part was when I was about to push off after our hangout, I've seen almost everyone inside drinking towers of Draught beer and when I've asked, they just ignored and didn't even care to respond. Like really? Speaking on everyone's behalf, it could be a budget constraint or someone's personal preference of beer, but not providing equal service to every customer is unprofessional and I'm really disappointed this time. Well, what can I say, Mustang is much better-They offer everything in the menu. I never expected that I'd drop such a review for one of the most happening pubs in HYD, but I really can't help it this time. Work this out asap.",1,"5 Reviews , 86 Followers",4/4/2019 22:55,0,

1. MASALA PEEENAT  - your normal peanuts with onions tomatoes and some spices. Decent munching

2. MASALA LIJJAT - this is masala papad with the same toppings as above, so we didn't quite enjoy it that much

3. BHEJ MANCHURIAN - Veg dry manchurian balls which were amazing!

4. JALAPENO CHEESE POPPERS - Unlike other jalapeno cheese poppers i've tasted elsewhere, these weren't very dry and bland. Also, good accompanying dip

5. ALOO PAKODE - aloo bhajiyas! Loved them! :D

6.  FRIES - good old classic salted fries! :)

The DJ played some really great songs! 
Had a great time, especially when they played the Bollywood music and most people were on their feet!",3,"262 Reviews , 1882 Followers",3/17/2019 13:21,0,
Tiki Shack,Manojkumar D Nambisan,"Food is good, especially the taste, but range is limited for main course. They have a good dance area though not marked out and hinders the movement. Outside seating is decent and service is better.",4,"29 Reviews , 11 Followers",3/16/2019 12:21,0,
Tiki Shack,Manoj Gangwar,"I will not recommend this place at all....I visited this place today with 7 friends
We were escorted by one of the tiki shack staff and asked to sit on a 8 seater table
After 15 mins another staff member came and asked us to move to another smaller table (meant for 5 pol max) when we asked for reason he was super rude and said this is Friday night and we will accommodate 20 ppl like you on this 8 seater table

I was shocked by this behaviour because we booked in advance before going there and i was ashamed in front of my friends that I recommended this place

After 10 mins of requesting him to give proper table We started to leave and no one cared as if they don't even bother ..When I complained to receptionist he finally responded positively and managed to get us a decent seat where I can accommodate my 7 friends

Now after all this drama no one was in mood of party so we left within 1 hr

Many thanks for spoiling our Friday night",1,"5 Reviews , 4 Followers",3/15/2019 22:53,0,

Tiki Shack,Sourav,"The quality of food and drink was really good. What turned out to be the biggest let-down was the service. A few of the waiters are really ignorant. They look for bigger groups to serve and circle around them only. With much effort we got a waiter to come and take our order. After waiting for half an hour, we enquired only to find out that the waiter had not put in the order at all. We got a new waiter to whom we had to re-iterate the whole thing. Although the new waiter was really polite and helpful, but our experience was already ruined. So my humble request is, if you don't like to serve a smaller group, mention it outside and we will definitely avoid your restaurant.",3,"3 Reviews , 4 Followers",3/12/2019 21:08,0,

Tiki Shack,Avin Seth,"Not that much great place, reason being the service is very slow. No one comes to take the order. Located in a great business area with all the big companies. The place has energy and good vibe but service is something that needs to be worked on. They have started serving different vapes at this place which costs around 700-800/-. Thats something cool you get in different flavours. Food is fine.

If you‚Äôre a person who would start off your clubbing night with some pop, electronic music and end it with proper punjabi dhol then this is the place for you.
AMazing Dj! He knew when to get the crowd exited.
I‚Äôve tried their Long Island iced tea and Johnny Walker.
LIT was amazing.. one of the best I‚Äôve had in the city.
Their chilly prawns was also yummy (not spicy enough for a Hyderabadi though)
Also, you get to try vape here! (Try their blueberry flavour, it‚Äôs dope)

Not many on the menu to chose from but they put up what they make the best and live up to it. Could add a little chinese main course on the menu but thats ok. Try the variety of drinks they serve and groove to their lovely choice of music. Enough eye candy for the guys and a fab ladies night for the girls.

Tiki Shack,Sneha Battula,"Visited this place on a Saturday evening cause I've heard a lot about Tiki Shack. The ambience was pretty decent and has a beautiful roof top view. But, I was honestly surprised that the food wasn't that great and infact I thought it was bad enough for all that I've heard from people.

Ordered non veg nachos and I hardly found any non veg in it. The pizza was quite bland too. One of the really bad pepporoni pizza I've had in my life.

A super-hit club of Jubilee Hills, as per me, is finding hard to live up to its reputation.

Standard Cocktails can be made better. In food, Nachoz is good but don't expect too much non-veg in non-veg nachos - feels more like veg. Achari murg is good and so is garlic bread. 

Music is good and sometimes they bring in Dhol wala to up the spirit

Tiki Shack,HungerDaddy,"Tiki Shak, Gachibowli - Hyderabad

The Gachibowli branch ofthis amazing pub was perhaps my best visit for having drinks, chit chat and dance with my group.

The place is only and solely for party animals, completely spacious with both indoor and outdoor seating. They have these amazing orange bulbs hanging from cane baskets on the ceiling and candlelit high seat tables.

The best time to go here is on Friday night after work, or when you feel claustrophobic at other pubs since the outdoor seating is breezy, plus there's live music by a DJ, live entertainment and wifi. So,dance at this spacious place without having to worry about bumping into your neighbours' feet.

Among drink they have everything from the regular combos of vodkas, regular margaritas, beer to Desi and angrezi whiskey. If you want to try something different after work, then do try their Helmet pop (for INR 980 - which is an experience in itself). This involves finishing your drinks bottoms up with a helmet that gets smashed with every glass you gulp.

For food, try their Chilli Cheese Toast, finger chips, Chilli chicken, masala peanuts and spring rolls. The prices are really pocket friendly.

Ambience was quite good -4/5

Service was okay -3.5/5

Food was average - 3.5/5

We had ordered 3 non veg starters and 3 veg starters. There weren‚Äôt many good options for veg starters and something veg that we ordered were just average at taste. And moreover that day there were only starters and main course was not available. When it comes to music this was the best part. The day we visited there was bhangra music. Apart form Bhangra the dj was good was playing mostly bollywood music. Overall if you want good bollywood music with not so great food you can surely try this place",3,"1 Review , 1 Follower",2/6/2019 0:11,0,
