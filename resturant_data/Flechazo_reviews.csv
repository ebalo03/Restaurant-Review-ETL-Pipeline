Flechazo,Vivek Vuppala,We were 4 people who visited this place on Thursday night....Ambience and service are good .Food is disappointed.Not worth for money we pay.,2,"2 Reviews , 40 Followers",5/24/2019 21:17,0,
Flechazo,Jalaj Goyal,"Here is one of the best buffet places for team lunch in Gachibowli area. This colourful place is so hospitable that you will just go muahhhh...

Ambience is quite good and has optimum free space. This place seems to be set up for team lunches only üòÇ. The menu present is splendid and too many items are there that you won't be able to taste each and every item(I don't even remember all the names!!!!

Starters are mouth watering (as I write), may it be veg or non veg. To begin, start with chaat counter which has a conveyor belt with plates arranged on it, this section includes sushi, golgappa, aamras shot, etc. This is self served so stop being lazy and go satiate your mouth watering taste buds!!

Delicious Starters are served on your table. The one of the attraction is the pizza oven!! You can be your own chef and try making a pizza of your choice and yeah you also get a Master Chef Certificate üòõ( Hoping you may use it in your resume). Main course also has some delicacies worth trying. I am not naming any because I was having foodgasm that I hardly cared to read names.

Desserts ahhahahhhaa!!!
You have good number of options of pastries and ice creams and indian sweets. I had gulaab jamun, halwa, pastries and Pan Ice cream(which is highly praised here)!!!

The ice creams are instantly prepared using liquid nitrogen and is a treat to watch. You will also find hot jalebis and etc etc etc.

Only drawback is that during high incoming rush, staff is in a hurry and you can't have much leisure time!!!

I would suggest go and give it a try with your team or gang... I believe that you won't regret trying this fabulous place!!!

Flechazo,Fairina Siddiqui,"I‚Äôm not going to this place again. Though the ambiance is good, Flechazo Gachibowli deeply lacks a sense of hygiene. We went there as a family. The first thing that caught our attention was the extremely sticky floor. The chefs at the live counters very well display the hygiene standards of this place. You find them standing idle meddling with the ingredients, scratching their heads and using their gloved hands to handle everything around. Another unique practice I noticed was that, while the waiter serves you the starters, he is constantly touching the serving spoons/tongs to the half eaten food in your plate. Then you find him serving the same starters to the next table.
The place is chaotic, with open dried up ingredients and food kept at most counters. The main course buffet has limited choices too.
But for the well thought of ambience, there is nothing positive I could write about this place.",1,"4 Reviews , 3 Followers",5/17/2019 18:43,3,

Flechazo,Sneha Battula,"Flechazo brings together two culinary regions of the the world- The Mediterranean and Asian. It has a minimalistic ambiance with maximised seating which serves as an ideal place for celebration or office gatherings.

Food shots on the conveyor belt has got an amazing response from the customers dining in. Gol Gappas, kachoris and the chaat options are a fun factor that makes up for the DIY concept to the table.

Starters: Stuffed Mushroom is a good option and Veg tempura is well balanced in its spice content.
Main course: You will have a whale of time picking out options in biryani, rice and curries. Leave some space for the pasta though.
Dessert: This section gives a whole new meaning to the term ""spoilt for choice"".

This place is indeed a foodie's delight.",5,"76 Reviews , 860 Followers",5/14/2019 12:03,0,
Flechazo,Meghna Basavaraj,"Visited on 12 may 2019, for lunch with family. Awesome food, comfortable seating, soothing ambience. Booked table through Zomato and received confirmation in 3 minutes!!

Went in early at 11.30am (brunch!). Welcome drink, soup and starters served at the table.. they have a mango festival till end of the month so most of the dishes have mango in them, super delicious.

Apart from the buffet spread, they have live counters for pizza, pasta, chaats (Pani Puri yummm...), sushi, keema kulcha and few others one bite snacks.. starters are aplenty; veg and non veg.. the servers are attentive and helpful.

Desserts was a mix of Indian sweets, pasteries, cheesecakes, fruits, and their speciality liquid nitrogen ice-cream, fun to watch though I am not sure if healthy..

I was surprised with a Mother's Day cake, complements of the restaurant.. that was a wow gesture.. a must visit place for celebrations or whenever you are hungry for variety and lots of food!!",5,"3 Reviews , 2 Followers",5/13/2019 14:45,0,

Flechazo,Ananya G,"I went to this place for lunch buffet by seeing the high ratings in zomato.

Good things first, the service is excellent! The waiters literally takes care of you when you are there.

Food: nothing great. As am more of a ""starter"" person , I love to have it in abundance but the starters were served on the table which ofcourse it's not served the way you like it. The sushi and Pani Puri were very okay-ish type
Main course was very normal, nothing extra ordinary. Taste of the food was very normal.
In dessert the red velvet cake and jalebi was good.

Service: it's very good and all the servers are trained very well.

Ambience: The place was jammed packed even for a Tuesday lunch. Couldn't enjoy that much as there was rush in front of every counter.

All in all a very okay-ish lunch!",3,"12 Reviews , 5 Followers",5/12/2019 19:49,0,

Flechazo,Vidhatri Reddy,An decent buffet ranging from your own customised pizza to the amazing starters. The place was crowdy even on a week day. Servers and chefs taking personalised comments on food delivered was very satisfying. But the finger food on conveyor belt was cold. The pizza needs flavour and tom yum soup is real disappointment.

2.no hard drinks available

Flechazo,Rajsi Gaikwad,"I absolutely loved this place. Let me begin how comfortable this place is. The sitting is comfortable and the arrangement here is handy. We were served with welcome drinks. Few starters were also placed on a small conveyer belt in a corner which consisted of , chat and fish. later actual starters were served to us on our place. For a non vegetarian prawns and all kinds chicken is a must try. For vegetarian chilly paneer, crispy corn, chilly fries. Here you can make your own pizza as well which helped us to gain some more space for the meal later. The Mediterranean pasta is better than the white one. Later we hurried for lunch because the sweets were waiting. The food was also good. In sweets the gulabjamun with badam kulfi and jalebi with rabdi was good. Even try pan ice cream.
The staff here is courteous and friendly as well.
Overall you can enjoy a happy, long, fun lunch or dinner with your friends/family/colleagues.",5,"50 Reviews , 69 Followers",5/6/2019 12:08,5,

Mutton kheema with masala kulcha also deserves a special mention.
The service is good and the staff is courteous too.

Flechazo,Rupayan Banerjee,It is seldom you see a restaurant with 4.9 rating. My friend and I had come with great expectations. But the restaurant didn't manage to live up to any of it. Even the 2 rating is because the staff was very polite and we had no complains there. Coming to the food: the sushi isn't good. The chef isn't aware that you don't give mayonnaise on sushi but wasabi. The starters were okay and we didn't repeat anything. In spite of being non vegetarians the only item we liked was the crispy corn. Then in aglio olio they used macaroni. The main course had a terrible array of dishes. And none was good. The biriyani had no chicken. The couscous salad had just quinoa and olives. The chocolate ice cream had an overdose of milk. All in all a very forgettable experience. However to reiterate the staff was good and after we politely told him about our experience he insisted on providing something special.,2,"11 Reviews , 80 Followers",5/1/2019 22:57,0,

They are not that tasty n didnot make a wow impact. Fish starter was awesome, prawn should be cooked more, chicken tikka was ok. Overall not convinced much with taste of starters. Maincourse was far better than starters and desserts were also ok. Can definitely visit but not with huge expectations on taste.",4,"61 Reviews , 26 Followers",4/26/2019 16:45,9,
