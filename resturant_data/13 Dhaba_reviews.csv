Packaging is nice although not separate. Food can't be stored, supposed to be eaten as and when ordered as both dal and rice are packed together.

13 Dhaba,Mallika Sen-Ali,"Outlet was once a treat for the Punjabi dishes, but over the period of time, the quality is going down and the so-called ‚Äògoooooddessst‚Äô taste has been missing the mark more than once.
Yesterday ordered for one portion of puri-choley and one portion of puri-alu. The puris were fat and oily. The alu curry was more like hing(asafoetida) Curry and had to dig through the gravy for choley. Our breakfast was definitely spoiled. In my last order of Rajma-chawal, same thing had happened. I really had to search for the rajmas in the gravy.
Wish the management will work upon the food quality. Because at this rate, they‚Äôre losing out on loyal customers.",1,"9 Reviews , 64 Followers",4/7/2019 9:46,0,

On My Plate: Buttery Aloo Paratha||Paneer Makhani||Raita

The Paratha that you see is just one half of the entire paratha. So imagine how ginormous is. The stuffing was perfect, neither too less, nor too much. The paneer was very softly cooked and absorbed the flavors of the spices, and the gravy too was amazing. The raita, with a bit of pepper in it added to the beauty of the lunch.",4,"34 Reviews , 131 Followers",8/27/2018 13:28,1,
13 Dhaba,Kitty Jain,"I am giving a bad rating not to the restaurant but because of zomato... Everytime I order food the instructions are not properly relayed to the restaurant and I end up getting something which I can't eat(for example spicy or with onions). They simply refuse to cancel the order and even if I ping them separately everytime they say ""system gitch"" .. very bad delivery service by zomato. Zomato clearly doesn't care about it customers but may be they will listen to the restaurants may be because, due to zomato restaurant's name is going for a sale here...",1,"3 Reviews , 92 Followers",8/26/2018 20:52,0,
13 Dhaba,Sudeep Joshi,"Amazing taste. Ordered Chole, Paneer dish and almost all the Naans. Quantity is also good compared to the price. Lassi and Milk Thandai were not so good. But the most important thing why I wouldn't rate it high is it's self service policy. The place is too small and even water isn't served. Not even tissue papers.",3,"2 Reviews , 3 Followers",8/26/2018 20:45,0,

13 Dhaba,Sankalp Chokkarapu,"Got to know about this by watching uber eats vedio and mouth publicity. Perfect place for a punjabi family and AUTHENTIC punjabi food lovers.

The paneer tikka I had here is the Best I ever had till date, it was totally cooked and servered with butter over. Paratas are huge enought to serve one and tests your appettite, stuffing is very good served with butter over and masala ratia.
Reccommend to go with a group so that you can taste all togeather.

Combos and different rice items available. Special 10% discount for bicycle and bullet riders. Self service so get your food own service is too good the person treat with huge respect. Worth visiting the place.",4,"144 Reviews , 1089 Followers",8/22/2018 21:27,4,

13 Dhaba,Ishita Narain,Have ordered from this place a couple of times and I must say that I have not had better alu parathas in Hyderabad than what they serve here. They are filled in so generously (unlike most places) that you can literally see small chunks of potatoes falling from them.,4,"96 Reviews , 353 Followers",8/15/2018 5:09,0,
