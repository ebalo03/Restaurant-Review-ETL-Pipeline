Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,The Food O‚ÄôClock,"This place is highly recommended. It is working with Eat India Company under the same roof, may be kitchen as well. Basically u ca order any of the two‚Äôs menu from one table. Eat India Company has Indian food while Urban Asia has asian food like chinese, thai food, etc.

We ordered The Real Bangkok Basa, Chef/Subba‚Äôs secret recipe noodles and Sanghai Fried Rice from Urban Asia.

The Real Bangkok Basa- It tastes so good. It was steamed Fish and mixed with some green sauce. Taste was 5/5 .

Subba‚Äôs secret recipe noodles was gravy noodles with lots of veggies, mushroom, chicken. Taste 5/5

Sanghai Fried Rice was a mixed of noodles and rice in which noodles was more than the rice. Taste was 5/5

Service 4/5, little bit slow in bringing food.

Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Rajshekher. 92,"The staff is kind and I think that's the moto of the Restaurant. The food is delicious, and there is the option for buffet and Alacarte, so we choose buffet which every thing they served on the table, which is really a good thing for me because I went with my parent. Coming to the food special I like the most, corn cube, prawn, fish, and yes ofcourse murgh angara..the staff cares about all its customers and are polite, just amazing..

Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Vamsi Krishna,"Came here on a Thursday evening for dinner only to be served the worst quality food. The service was absolutely terrible... no air conditioning in the sweltering heat ... after multiple requests we got our food ( literally begged for the food to be served)... what‚Äôs not there on the buffet menu also they don‚Äôt tell the customer... the main course was served cold... pre-scooped ice creams.. and what not

Some mango juice they served... don‚Äôt know how that was drinkable ....

Worst decision to spend our evening here .. absolutely terrible experience

Giving one star because I can‚Äôt give -5

FOOD = -100/5
Service - can‚Äôt put a negative number that high
Ambience - no air conditioning on a summer evening

Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Pushkar Shah,"Visited Urban Asia based on their rating and reviews. However, we were utterly disappointed. We visited the Gachibowli location of the restaurant and it is clubbed with East India Co. The waiter handed us the ""Signature"" menu and that is when the ordeal began. Most of the signature dishes were unavailable. It was surprising since it was a Saturday and I assumed that the restaurant would be well prepared to handle something important as their Signature Menu. Eventually, we had to settle for the buffet which was priced at 650++. Overall a disappointing evening.",3,3 Reviews,4/26/2019 10:04,0,

Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Thejoyoffood,"Amongst the so many options now available for dining at Gachibowli, Urban Asia is difficult to ignore both for location and food. Getting in there if you are driving can be tricky sometimes since there is too much traffic in a narrow lane. However, they have a valet in the basement and you can park there and head over to the 4th floor which actually is a mix of a few restaurants. The place offers both buffet and a-la-carte options and you could choose what you like. We ordered Pad Thai noodle and chilly Tofu. I have not had such soft and delicious todu in a long time and was happy to have given that a shot. Moreover, the portion size was fairly decent. The Pad Thai tasted slightly sweet to my wife's liking but again flavoursome and good portion. The place was quiet and you could enjoy your food in peace.

Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Durgesh Thakur,"Used to be a frequent visitor at this place. Was total disappointed yesterday night . Food was aweful to taste. Chicken starter in bean sauce was bitter in taste. They we're serving what they deemed fit for us and not as per our order. Chicken lababdar was wanting in taste, fennel seeds were used and curry was as thin as a soup , no one was nearby when serving were required. Service is what we look forward to when dining in your restaurant.Either there was change in chef or some other temporary issues. Hope it would be fixed soon and we will not be disappointed when dining next time with our friends.",5,"2 Reviews , 1 Follower",4/7/2019 21:07,0,

Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,ThePanda,"We have been to Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar, Gachibowli. We ordered crisp noodles (shrimps) with sweet and sour sauce which was obviously a wrong choice. Crispy noodles is never a right choice (at least for me) wherever you go and sweet n sour soup with shrimps just made it worse. I am a seafood lover and the quantity and size of shrimps didn't justify its price. Next was Standing Pomfret dish in schezwan sauce...which turned out to be a disappointment.

The food is nice but the fancy dishes fail to impress. Had ordered Lotus leaf fried rice - but that neither had any distinguishing flavor of lotus leaf nor a hint of chili oil, but what lets you down is the service - Too SLOW.

And they also goofed up on the Zomato 1+1 food offer. They later corrected it, but not before arguing.

Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,^beingRAJAT,"Dissatisfaction and Disappointment!

Urban Asia Gachibowli !
I am here for a lunch buffet but alas, wasnt what I was expecting. Starters Pathetic !
The prawn is okaish, apart from that everything stands to be a disaster. Uncooked Chicken Malai kababs to kabab mei "" huddi"" (bone).
Beware of the dirty, stinky and glue piece of cloth napkin!!

Soup served was a shorba which tasted masala warm water. The mocktail tasted really good. Finally !!

Coming to the main course I am not putting up any pictures as they were average ! Trust me nothing special !!

The chat counter was good. U can try that. From Chole kulche to Bhel puri. 4 items.

Deserts: limited but were good.

Ice Cream: They were making it on a ice tray however some local base brand.

Overall
Food 3/5
Service 1/5
Value for Money 2.5/5

Recomended only if you can grab the buffet in a deal.

Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,The Greedy Hippo,"On a Saturday casual lunch, i was simply floored by the ambiance they have set up. And I couldn't stop looking at the artifacts they have put up. Its like one could just spent hours looking at them and admiring the heritage of India.

I was in mood for chinese and went full blast.
The wonton soup superceded the manchow one.
The dragon prawns were okayish. The sangdown chicken wings could have been more jucier.

Coming on to the main course, we had ordered a barrage of items.
Sanghai fried rice: loved it
Kung pao chicken : delicious
Hunan chicken : bland, had to parcel
Shrimp soft noodles: good
Bamboo fried rice: good
Pan fried noodles in Cantonese sauce: a disaster.

For my part I had ordered food which turned out to be best, my friends were dissapointed.

The mojito and virgin mojito were good and packed a punch.

I loved everything about this restaurant and would be back here to try my favourite kung pao chicken. It has stuck on my taste buds.

The quantity they serve is too good, one main course can be shared by two with moderate appetite.

Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Shouvik Acharyya,"This place is nothing as it is shown in the images. The ambience maybe good, but the service is too bad. The chicken salt and pepper was nothing as simple as I thought and the tai pei crispy chicken was not all crisp. And if this was not enough the add on was the main course. The name mentioned in the menu for the main course resembles more of a continental food, which creates a lot of confusion. We ordered three dishes for main course not having any about the fact that the dishes are gravies, rather than semi gravy. The worst is the suggestions from the manager, who suggested us to have a rice item along with the dishes we ordered. Knowing that the dishes comes with gravy and it would be too much for 3 people to have that much gravy, it was very disappointing to have a suggestion from them. Moreover despite of showing the Zomato gold coupon the code was not added and even after having such a bad experience and complaining about the food, they added an extra service charge to the final bill. Won't complain much about the ambience but the food menu is a bit confusing.
My suggestion would be if you already had a drink or too its better not to order without asking, and importantly don't try and take suggestion from the management.
Been to many Asian restaurants, had bad food, but never got so confused about the menu. I had Sandip Acharyya with me. Both of us are very dissapointed.

1. Garlic Fried rice - good
2. Mixed veggies in schezwan sauce - good
3. Mixed mushroom platter - did not please my taste buds. Left half the dish. I am not a fan of any mushroom other than the button mushroom. Even if I liked other mushrooms, I wouldn't have liked this dish. It's nothing special. Tasted like simple sauted mushrooms.
4. Showstopper - Yin Yan soup. Half of it was a thick corn soup which has a subtle sweet taste. The other half of it had thick coriander soup. I think this is what they serve full bowl as lemon coriander soup. Fan of this. Coming back for this soup.",3,"27 Reviews , 52 Followers",1/15/2019 16:53,4,
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Rishav Sarkar,"Visited this branch of Urban Asia this afternoon for lunch. The Eat India Co (Indian Restaurant) is just beside Urban Asia and I read few reviews about this place (Urban Asia, Gachibowli) not serving food as good as the Jubilee Hills branch as they share the same kitchen. But as I experienced today, these branch is as good as the other one. They have maintained the food quality, quality exactly the same. Even the buffet has nice spread of Asian menu as well as some Indian dishes. Ordered our favourite Pork Ribs which is very very delicious. Ordered Some Chilli Lamb and Orange chicken. Chilli lamb was really delicious but the Orange Chicken was average cause we asked for less gravy and it was a lot of gravy. (I don‚Äôt like sweet dishes. May be it‚Äôs the authentic Orange Chicken)

Mild music. Mild air conditioning. Very clean. Definitely try the fried prawns as part of the starters. Wasabi needs to be more like the real wasabi. They need to serve the sushi along with the wasabi and soy sauce provided in small bowls - the bowls we're missing. And you had to ask for the wasabi as well. Should be part of the table sauces, etc. Good to go there once in a while.",3,"2 Reviews , 2 Followers",1/2/2019 11:45,0,
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Karpurmanjari Kakati,"We opted for alakarte here. But the took a round of the food variety for buffet, it was pretty good. But the dessert section didn't interest me much.

The buffet had dumplings, sushi, which I felt were food for buffet.

We we in mood to eat proper Chinese. We ordered a pork dimsum, stir fried chicken starter.
Another chicken main course and fried rice.

Everything was good.

But then comes the bill part.

I Really don't know how they missed the Zomato 1+1 to cut from the bill.
Also they had so 91 bucks extra S. Tax apart from GST.
Which made us change the bill again.

Honestly speaking, after serving good food, missing the gold and adding extra money apart from GST decreases the moral value for the place.

Kindly try avoiding the addition of that.

Rest food is good.
Service if good.
Can come back again for another turn of Chinese.!!",3,"135 Reviews , 420 Followers",1/2/2019 7:54,0,
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Vijay Chandra,"The rating for the food taste is always 4/5 here but when comes to service I can't rate more than 1.5/5, the 0.5 is just for getting bill quickly and may be 1 for getting few dishes immediately. I visited this restaurant for the fifth time expecting to get better food and service than last time, but it is always degrading. We came in to Lunch at around 2:45, the first thing which irritated was they were served me cold starters and I complained then they went and heated it up and served, this was corn cubes, they promised 11 started in the buffet menu and they never bothered to serve all. I had to ask him to check what the menu was and can he serve all of them and still they never served. I think they were supposed to serve soup at table along with starters which they always did before, I went and asked them about it then they said it is available at the buffet section and we can go and get it. I really felt like going to a place where they were serving free food and we had to go and ask for what we wanted. It was absolutely ridiculous experience, they started turning off the lights when we're still eating, I agree we were late but switch off all the lights and we go out in a kind of darkness? It is no more pathetic situation, like they are not bothered about the customers, and we can get in if we want.

Service was very good as we got started with a manager standing close by and ensuring service was happening briskly. Two of us went with the buffet and others went ala carte. The buffet appetizers served at the table were good and served hot. Veg appetizers were good, chicken was very average and the fish was quite good. Budget however looked tired and like food had been sitting for a while. We didn't have much appetite after the starters so that was good. Lots of little desserts - pastries looked better than they tasted, but kids enjoyed the ice cream cold stone.

Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Sourav Datta,"A beautiful Asian restaurant with awesome food.

Food : 4.5/5 Tried some items from their special menu and some from their normal menu. The soup was awesome and the way it was presented with two clear demarcation between the two flavors made it even more special. The dumplings were really good, it was juicy at the center with a very thin crust. The dumpling dip could have been better though. The Nyonya was again very delicious and the lemon grass flavor in the curry was just out of this world. The Nasi Goreng was very smelly of dried fish and something that we did not enjoy. Have tried their buffet also earlier and liked the unconventional nature of the buffet which servers Indian and Asian together. The green curry in the buffet was again very delicious.

Ambiance : 3.5/5 This is actually two restaurant under the same roof. I am not sure why was that done and other than the buffet it really does not make any sense sense.

Service : 4/5 Service was again very good. They took the time to explain the dishes notified of the possible wait time for any dish and above all were very friendly.

Price : 3.5/5 It is priced at per some of the fine dining restaurant and as such is fair. The only thing is that in such fine dining set up you should not run a buffet and a la carte in parallel.",4,"78 Reviews , 1612 Followers",11/18/2018 23:11,3,

We ordered from Urban Asia's menu, and the food was good. The service, on the other hand, is a little disappointing probably because of the confusion between the restaurants.

‚úìAmbience

This is very much spacious having multiple separated halls for group dining with cozy ambience. This restaurant is themed with village style vintage wooden decors all-around the place. Most of the interior walls are covered with vintage wooden doors, windows and locks.

And also there is a separate dining hall where one of the wall is completely covered with photo frames of old nizami Kings and their belongings.

‚úìFood

We went here for a dinner buffet. The food is really delicious and this was the first time I was liking Sea food in the starters. All the starters are really good but Kung Pao fish and Prawns parsely dry are the best of its kind.

Dinner Buffer Menu:

*Starters:

1. Murgh Haryali Tikka
2. Lahsooni Murgh Tikka
3. Kung Pao Fish
4. Prawns Parsely dry
5. Crispy Potato Corn cube

8. Corn Tikka
9. French fries

We don't have much variety in desserts but the ice creams here are really good and served with different luscious toppings. Just looking at them will trigger the cravings in your mouth.

‚úìService

The only saddest part of this restaurant is the service that they provide. Though it is a buffet, All the starters will served to the table. There is a lot much interval from one starter to the other starter that they serve.

And you will feel that half the time your plate is empty and you need to keep on waiting for them to serve. The service part of this restaurant is really irritating and this needs to be corrected with much importance.

‚úìValue for money

The dinner buffet here costs around Rs.650/- per person. And you will definitely feel that this place is worth your money. Be prepared to bear with the bad service and rest you will definitely enjoy. Have a great dining and good dayüòä",3,"64 Reviews , 540 Followers",10/31/2018 2:40,24,

This restaurant has Eat India Company and Urban Asia merged into one. So u get both North Indian and Asian cuisine menus together. Bit confusing at the start, especially because the waiters don't address this.
Ordered water chestnut in honey pepper sauce. Like the dish, could have been less spicy though.
Next up was chicken dumpling. This was yummy.
Chicken Thai red curry was good and creamy, but again was a bit spicy for Thai curry. Think the restaurant needs to tone down the spicy quotient of Asian food, otherwise the food was fresh and tasty.",4,"77 Reviews , 323 Followers",10/25/2018 18:31,11,

Honestly I dont dig Indo-Chinese, but these guys had a pretty good spread and that included the normal Indian dishes. Quick service and very polite staff, got those starters real quick and they were good, nothing over the top, just old school good stuff.
Main course lacked the punch though there was variety, if you are really up for the mood, you might be disappointed otherwise it's ok. The desserts was a total miss, nothing there actually.

We had made it crystal clear that we were Zomato Gold holders and they said we could show the ID later. How is it fair that the staff asks us for the ID after the restaurant has closed and when we could not unlock it!! We are first time users of Zomato Gold.
We had to walk out. Horrible service. Stay away from this place if you do not want to be treated poorly by the manager and the staff. Thank you for ruining a special day!!!

Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Abhishek Mandal,"Our first experience with Urban Asia was pretty average however since then every time we visited this place it has been beyond satisfactory. The first time although the food was good the experience was impacted by very poor service, long wait time without any clear information of the duration and disastrous preparation of one of the items (the name of which I don't remember unfortunately).

The establishment houses two different restaurants (Eat Street and Urban Asia) under the same roof and without any strict boundary. You can choose to sit anywhere you please depending on availability. The service usually is prompt and courteous . Overall ambiance is decent with touches of fun in the form of comments written on the wall.

Since we love Asian Cuisine the food is the highlight for us and although all the items we tried during our multiple visits are excellent I would like to specially mention the Nasi Goreng. We have tried it in many restaurants in India besides having it in Bali and this place comes closest to match the authentic taste and presentation. Susi was also excellent, very fresh and delicious.

Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Ankit Jain,"A must visit place for their exquisite Asian cuisine ,not just for the dishes they offer but also for the authentic taste of those dishes !

The ambience is so appropriate to aggrevate your hunger and salivate your mouth. One does start feeling the aura of fine dine - for which the crockery and cutlery is the first noticable example.

We ordered vegetable chilli sticks ,salt and pepper chicken as starters .
Vegetable chilli sticks (1st pic) is a must for all vegetarians here ,if felt really satiating having tasted one of the best Chinese dish I ever ordered (5/5)

Salt and pepper chicken was good - as told by my accompanying friend . I found the texture good ! He rates it (4/5)

For Main course we ordered chilli garlic soft noodles and button mushroom and diced babycorn in oyster sauce gravy dish .

Chilly garlic noodles were cooked with finesse with perfect combination of spices and flavour of veggies .very balanced ! A must to mention is the quantity served , it can be shared by 3 people (4.5/5)

Button mushroom ,diced babycorn in oysters sause- this dish is basically fried mushroom and babycorns tossed in oyster sauce that is medium spicy . It blended so perfectly with the spicy noodles .(4/5)

I also ordered virgin mojito which comprised of ice and only ice and they charged 160 bucks for that (2/5)

Final verdict - authentic asian food with great ambeicne .with Zomato gold it makes it really worth giving it not just one try but visit here frequently !",4,"138 Reviews , 821 Followers",8/13/2018 1:47,3,
Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Joyita Bhattacharya,"I went to this restro yesterday for dinner with my husband to beat the monsoon dullness. This outlet is in Gachibowli Rd above Ratnadeep store. There are couple of other restros and to be precise its on the 4th floor.
It was little surprising as this restro share the common space with Eat India Company.
We did not have any prior booking but was amused as there were scarcely couple of diners in the weekend !
One of the staff directed us to a crampy place and we outrightly rejected his proposal. The staff was rigid and told that the place where we wanted to sit with a nice view was already reserved !

We were also curt and told them that if we dont sit in a comfy area, we have other choices.Reluctantly they agreed but I was surprised that hardly two or three diners came while we were having dinner !
They could have attended our request in the first go for the feel good quotient.

Anyways let me quickly summarize the orders we made there-

1. Crabmeat Soup- This soup was thick with minced crab meat. The broth was bland and you can customise it by infusing soy sauce, vineager and crushed pepper. The whiff of craby flavor will surely tingle your taste buds.
2. Corn Cubes - A must try out platter. The dish was innovative. The american corn flour was mixed with miniscule chopped vegetables. Then the kneaded flour was frozen in small cubes and were golden fried. It was crisp and at the same time had a jelly consistency.
3. Chicken Yakitori- I did not like this preparation. It was very dull and tasteless. There were six skewered chicken sticks with capscicum and onion. The chicken pieces were succulent but did not imbue any flavor.

Main Course -

1. Manchow Chicken Fried Rice - The rice was flavorful and spicy with lots of veggies and diced chicken pieces in it. It was a bit sticky and can be consumed at its own.

Dessert
1. Bangkok Custurd- I was assuming that this dessert will be cold but it was just the opposite. The custurd was hot and thick and made with coconut puree. The thick sauce was decadent with loads of nuts ! It tasted like Firni. As accompaniment there were thin crusty pineapple spring rolls. It was just yum for the greedy tongue.

Total- Rs. 1396 ( Inclusive of taxes )

Cobclusion - The price range is moderate and the portion is generous in amount.The food is delectable but did not have any exlusive or signature dish which can attract guest for the next time.

The staffs are inexperienced and do not have knowledge abot the items put in the menu card. No coordination among the staffs. Either different staffs will come and ask for the same course of order for multiple times or no one will attend the guest.

The dessert section in the menu card is quite attractive but most of the items are not available. I had a discussion on this with the manager but rather than taking it as a constructive feedback he delved himself into arguments !

This is not the place to enjoy your special occassions. Its just okayish for casual dinner/ lunch. I will think twice to visit this place again.",3,"20 Reviews , 54 Followers",8/12/2018 9:48,7,

Urban Asia - Kitchen & Bar,Soumosri Pal,"#urbanasia #panasian #delightfulexperience.

Well this place is quite an old one in jubilee hills standing strong for quite a long time now. The food here is an absolute delight. When they say PAN ASIAN , they mean PAN ASIAN . The experience of the jubilee hills branch was so amazing that I was being pulled to try their gachibowli branch. And I would love to visit this place over and again, if not for anything but the ORANGE CHICKEN.

Food( 4/5)

The food here is an absolute delight. No chance is left for any complaint. Good to mention, both the time I have tried ala carte and not the buffet.

Starting with the spare ribs to the chilli basil Chiken to the sanghai prawns, all of them were absolutely delicious. The spare ribs is a must try as the same taste quite different from the normal spare ribs, it has a Chinese tinge instead of a continental touch which is taste changer.
The aroma of the chilli basil chicken is enough to fill the heart with good vibes. Fresh, refreshing yet light on stomach this item is a perfect starter.

The sanghai praws are good, well cooked and a bit tangy to change the taste bud.

Amongst all their dishes , my all time favorite which pull me to this place over and again is the ORANGE CHICKEN , which is a must must try here. This dish is an absolute delight to the minf, soul and taste bud. This I believe is the most innovative pan Asian dish which I haven't had in a long time. I call this an innovative dish because no other pan Asian restaurant is able to provide with such a perfect dish with the right mixture of everything.

Service (4/5)

I believe a restaurant can be surely judged by it's staff.. Here the staff knows all their dishes so well that they are promptly able to suggest you with the right dishes to compliment each other. Kudos to the staff.

Ambiance ( 4/5)

As urban Asia is a chain of restaurant, we were made to sit at their Indian counterpart as it was a Saturday night and quite late . The interior is quite interesting and has a touch of the rural India in it's decor which I guess is a perfect combination for the Indian restaurant.
