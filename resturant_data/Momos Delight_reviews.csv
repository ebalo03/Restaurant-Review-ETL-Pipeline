Momos Delight,Monica Pandey,Ordered because I wanted to eat momos so much and DLF area is popular for street food but I am Disappointed! The momos were undercooked and dry. Had ordered two veg steamed momos and I felt sad because it neither fulfilled my cravings nor it filled my tummy. The closings were hard and uneatable.,1,"1 Review , 28 Followers",5/18/2019 23:26,1,
Momos Delight,Gautam Narang,"So it‚Äôs 11:30 on a Friday night, most of the restaurants are closed and we are hungry. We find this restaurant still delivering with ratings more than four. We order Veg Steamed Momos and Chicken Steamed Momos. We get the delivery on time and the food is not bad. Schezwan Sauce is steamy hot and delicious; but both the Momos on the drier side. Hence going with 3/5 for this restaurant.",3,"16 Reviews , 82 Followers",5/18/2019 0:24,0,
Momos Delight,Ritwik Borgohain,"I ordered the steamed chicken and fried chicken momos.
The momos are pretty terrible, especially considering how much they are asking for it. I've had cheaper and better momos from roadside vendors.They also made my stomach upset which is a sure sign of them serving old and unhygienic food since even the roadside momos have never done this to me.

I would definitely steer clear of this place, especially if you have ever had even half decent momos from anywhere else.  Also this is the first time someone has given mayo with momos and I can confirm that the combination is as disgusting as it sounds.If you have poor taste in food or have a stomach made of iron, then sure, go ahead and order from this farce of a momo joint. Otherwise learn from my mistake and let it be the only one to have occurred.",1,"2 Reviews , 26 Followers",5/10/2019 23:12,0,
Momos Delight,Anjanaa Karthik,"All the Hyderabadis out here, anybody who here who loves street food, obviously, DLF is out there for you ! But don't forget to look out for this shop. You would find steamed and fried momos, but it's very rare to find kurkure momos. Have you even heard about those? Wanna grap a taste ? Go to DLF right away ! :)
It's mouth smacking.",4,"42 Reviews , 53 Followers",5/9/2019 17:36,1,
Momos Delight,Biswarup Bose,One of the best places to have momos in and around gachibowli. Located right opposite to DLF this place is over till late night. My favourite is the kurkure momo here.

Momos Delight,Pallavi Mitra,"Paneer fried momo was yummy. Thank you, the Mayo and sauce was good. Momos could be more softer, fried was too crispy. Taste could also improve much more.",3,"12 Reviews , 2 Followers",4/16/2019 20:46,1,
Momos Delight,Jay Mehta,"Watching ipl and ordred norfest, thought of adding some appetizer to my meal...ordered kurkure momos vegetarian.

Arrived nice and hot and on time

Problem- the fried kurkure felt fried on stale oil, the coating was really thick tasted more of the oil coating than anything inside.

Sauce was mayo and red sauce. I am not sure how ppl eat mayo with momos? Antways i tried the red sauce , thinking that sauce may help with thick coating and oil, sauce was realy confusing zero taste just sodium thats it!

Lessons- never order fried momos again EVER! May try the steamed based on rating.",2,"46 Reviews , 43 Followers",4/12/2019 22:44,1,

Momos Delight,Sri D,"I never had a good momos until before I ordered from here. Always thght momos were over-rated. But Momos Delight proved me wrong. I ordered veg- kurkure momos through Zomato and they were lip-smacking good. The red-chilli chutney and mayonnaise were good combination with the momos. Also, they were delivered to me when they are still hot. Zomato‚Äôs service has never been disappointing.",5,3 Reviews,3/31/2019 20:42,0,
Momos Delight,Avinash Agarwal,It may appear slightly expensive for momos. But they truly taste as amazing if not better than the best momos you had in a north eastern Indian city.

Momos Delight,Mouboni Dutta,I have been here and had it's momos. It was not that great! So i had ordered chicken steamed momos on zomato and was disheartened to find that the momos have degraded further in it's taste. The outer covering was dry and not well cooked. It tasted like it was not freshly made. The filling was not satisfying at all. Moreover the salt was a bit over the top. The sauce served was excessively salty and tasted like tomato sauce mixed with chilli paste. Not good at all. I had been in their shop quite e few times but this time it was really disappointing.,2,"5 Reviews , 2 Followers",2/28/2019 0:37,0,

Momos Delight,Saswati Kar Choudhury,"So on one of the weeknite i craved for momos.Most of the delivery points were closed except this.So thot to give it a try.Delivery was delayed and that made me lil upset.I ordered two things: Veg steamed momos and chicken steamed momos.

Veg steamed momos:The packaging was real bad and u cud see momos out of the silver foil box.The filling of the momo wasnt really pleasing and was not tasty enuf to swat my mood.The veggies seemed to be over burnt and they didnt smell good either.The schezwan chutney that they usually setve with momos was more lookinglike tomato ketchup and the quantity was so lil that it cud just suffice 1 momo.
Chichen steamed momo:All of the above applies though the chicken smelled as if it was day old.

Highly disappointing! 2stars just for the zomato valet!",2,"51 Reviews , 232 Followers",2/21/2019 23:02,0,

Momos Delight,Rajat Goel ‚ú≥Ô∏è,"A small kiosk among the many eateries opposite the DLF building. A friend recommended this place as authentic Delhi style Momos, so stopped by.

At around 9pm, only steamed chicken Momos (60/5) were available. They were absolutely steamy hot, soft and delicious. Inside the thin Momo skin, was a large filling of minced chicken meat, minimal veggies. Just perfect.

Momos were served with a nice spicy and tangy red chilly chutney, and a dollop of mayonnaise, that I left. Somehow the combination of Momos and Mayo didn't work for me.

They have crusted 'Kurkure' momos that weren't available, but hope to try them sometime later!

Here's my overall SCORE:
Food - 5/5 (Chicken filling! ‚≠ê)
