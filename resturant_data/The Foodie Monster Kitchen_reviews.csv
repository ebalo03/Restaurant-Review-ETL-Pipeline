The Foodie Monster Kitchen,Veggie-Lover,"Big fan of All day Breakfast in bed? Order from this amazing little eatery!

From vegetarian heart shaped nutella pancakes to a classic English breakfast with omelettes and hash browns they‚Äôve got it all.

They also have a dine-in available if you wish to drop by. Not to mention the place also whips up some amazing shawarma and rice combos.

Juices to coffee, they‚Äôve got everything you need. All this without burning a hole in your pocket.

In picture:

I had ordered their Nutella Pancakes and coffee: the packaging was perfect and the Nutella was well smothered. The coffee hadn‚Äôt leaked either.
While the pancakes were true to being eggless the baking soda/powder was slightly overpowering. But still manages to be one of the best eggless pancakes joint for me.",4,"96 Reviews , 1069 Followers",4/14/2019 10:31,2,
The Foodie Monster Kitchen,Anuj Rajani,"As of now, I have tried 2 rice bowls and 1 shawarma from here -
1) non veg green slimy monster bowl
2) veg the iron monster bowl
3) desi original chicken shawarma

All 3 of them i liked a lot, especially 1) and 3).

Me being a healthy food eating person, instructions of using less oil and less chilli were correctly taken into account by the restaurant and the taste also was great.

Quality and quantity were both quite satisfying. Great job.üëåüèªüëçüèª

One suggestion from my side will be to add calories, ingredients and nutritients information (for ex: protein, fat, carbs content; micro nutrients information) for each dish being offered. This will be very helpful for everyone especially for people like me who want to eat clean and healthy.",4,1 Review,4/13/2019 16:08,0,
The Foodie Monster Kitchen,Subhashree Dey,I ordered Red Monster box mini for 95 rupees. 4 pieces of fried chicken were there. The taste was good. There was another box which had chicken makhani with biryani rice. The quantity was very less. It was not enough for one person.

The Foodie Monster Kitchen,Ankita,"Located near DLF, IIIT - This small place is mostly for Swiggy orders. Interior is simple and cosy. We had combo deals booked through Dineout. We were supposed to have pizza squares but they had run out of it. So they offered another shawarma instead. Shawarma and nuggets were served first. After waiting for sometime we got the mint cooler and waffles.

Food is tasty and delicious. However service is bit slow.

Tells you blatantly that your order will take time (more than 40 mins before I placed the order). I checked in at 8 40 am!
Ambience is a great miss for sure. Super duper uncomfortable seats.
Add:
The pancakes are very average. Could be more fluffy.
They did not have waffles, so i can't tell.
Eggs: shambles not scrambled. Over salty in places. No salt in rest of the place. Why are you charging so much if you can mess up eggs.
Tea: the only reason I beimg kind and can say 2.5 is tea. Lovely tea. Quite a hassle btw for just tea though üòÇ",2,"18 Reviews , 146 Followers",1/20/2019 8:41,1,
The Foodie Monster Kitchen,Anish Mahapatra || Thefoodpotato,"I had ordered 2 varieties of shawarma. The order reached on time. The packaging was good and the Shawarmas itself were hot, creamy and delicious. It was wrapped in foil paper and quantity was sufficient wrt price. I used the 50%off coupon from Zomato. I recommend this place.

What a shawarma it was.. I ordered twice from this restaurant, though it has been quite while since I ordered, my bad.. The good things need to be acknowledged whthr late or early it doesn't make any difference. Let's start with the review. I ordered
1. shawarma
2. colddrink
3. waffle+ ice-cream for the frst time and secomd time I onlu ordered chicken shwrma.

What a treat it was to look at the packaging taste and everything was so good.I am quitd impressed by their service. They need to work on just one thing.

Imrovement Needed

The portion size should be a little more.

This is the first place I came with my best friend. He forced me to come out of my room and asked me to decide about the food. Shawarmas. That was it. I saw that I could try the vegetarian version here, so I was happy.

We had our respective types of Shawarmas: he had chicken and I was more than joyous about having the vegetarian one. We got to listen to good music, hear the incessant chatterboxes talking out loud but we found silence in our own way and conversed about our ideas. It was good food, good company and a great experience. Just that, it can hurt your pocket a little!",4,"122 Reviews , 639 Followers",12/1/2018 22:53,0,

Waffles,pancakes,scrambled eggs and cold coffee)and Veg iron monster(panneer biryani and coke) pancakes were yummy along with maple sauce,scrambled eggs were amazingly toasted without using much oil.panneer biryani was just ok a bit more flavoured.Cold coffee tasted like regular one.Packing quality needs to be improved.",4,"88 Reviews , 320 Followers",10/7/2018 23:31,6,

What I ordered - best of both worlds which is a combination of waffles and pancakes served with scrambled egg accompanied by choice of beverage which I choose tea
Price - 199 plus taxes.
Food review - the food was in general leaning towards healthy taste though it was not mentioned as such. The scrambled eggs were without any kind of spices and just tossed in butter. Pancake was nice and fluffy but the maple syrup was too less to enjoy it fully u can see the pics. Waffles tasted bland but may be coz it was just plain waffle and it was too hard thumbs down üëá. Tea was really nice and was warm enough and they provided a disposable cup which was quite cute. Special mention to the superb packaging and value for money which urged me to give an extra one star though the food was a 3 üåüüåüüåü for me.

Regarding the service, the waiters were good & humble the service was good but faced an issue with the payment. Their swiping machine wasn‚Äôt working so i had to go for an ATM which irritated me.

All the rice bowls(both veg and non veg), the varieties of omlette, waffels(monster egg and monster chicken), different types of shawarmas, french fries and banana pancakes.

We went here to bid farewell to one of our friend and tried all the above varieties. All turn out be yummy!!! Simple and sober.

The Foodie Monster Kitchen,Divya Reddy,I had ordered out everytime. The packaging is excellent although the food is okayish. The shawarma is like having roti and malai chicken. The rumali roti is soft and the filling inside is moist. There was not punch of flavour but a monotony on the pallette. Also their waffles are okayish too.,3,"104 Reviews , 398 Followers",7/2/2018 7:47,0,
