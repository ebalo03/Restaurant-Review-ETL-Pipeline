The Fisherman's Wharf,Himanshuwadhwa11,"One of the best restaurants visited till date in HYD. The have amazing ambience, delicious food and extremely courteous staff.
They are pro at making all the different delicacies and try to make sure that the customer walks out satisfied.
It is a must visit restaurant and has amazing North Indian food specially Dal Makhni and Paneer Butter Masala. The desserts are also amazing. All in all complete value for money.",5,"5 Reviews , 1 Follower",5/25/2019 17:56,0,
The Fisherman's Wharf,Jasmin,"Special occasions call for unique celebrations accompanied by some fantastic fare. Dinner last night at Fisherman‚Äôs Wharf was one such memorable experience. Spread across an acre, with multiple dining sections carved around the garden courtyard it transports you to the coast. We choose to sit in one of the Mangalore tiled pavilions with mist fans and earthy furniture.

Now coming to the food, started with the masala fried prawns marinated in toddy vinegar. Accompanied by these soft paos the prawns with a hint of tanginess were one of the best I have had in recent times. Chicken xacuti with boneless chicken pieces wrapped in a robust spices was scrumptious and went very well with both the tandoori roti and the pao. Goan style coconut base fish curry which came along with rice was enjoyable but not exemplar.  

Sweet ending with the classic bebinca along with vanilla ice-cream  to complete the meal. The setting, food, and moreover the gracious service made it a top notch experience for us. After redemption of the Zomato Gold offering we paid 1474 for three adults and one child",5,"120 Reviews , 562 Followers",5/22/2019 16:55,0,

The Fisherman's Wharf,Arpa Ghosh,"On a Sunday evening, my wife got some serious cravings for sea food. So the first name that came to my find was ""Fisherman's Wharf"". On my last trip to Goa, I had the opportunity to visit their outlet near Mobor beach(South Goa). I won't say that I had an awesome food experience, but I was blown away by their ambiance! Although they have opened an outlet in Hyderabad, for quite sometime , but somehow we were yet to visit. So on Sunday 19th May, 2019, it was time for redemption. We visited the place around at 8:30 pm in evening , and by just watching the sheer numbers of cars parked, I could figure out that it was a full house!

Ambiance
===========
At the reservation table, we were courteously greeted. Then we were taken inside and had our indoor seat at ""Panjim"" restaurant. We would had loved an outdoor or upper deck seats, but unfortunately all were reserved! Starting from decors, live music, the lighting, well all I could say was that place was lively! The ambiance may not be as good as their South Goa outlet, but its not lagging that far, either! Ratings - 4/5.

Service
===========
As we were seated indoors at the ""Panjim"" restaurant, Himanshu was in-charge of our table. He was polite , courteous and efficient.  He was prompt in taking the order for us and the food came literally in no time. Top-notch! Ratings - 5/5.

Food
===========
Ta-da, here comes the big deal! My wife had prawn curry rice and I had fish and chips.   The prawn curry had thick gravy, prepared with coconut milk and Goan spices and tasted yum!  It was served with steamed rice. For the fish and chips fillet, well the size of the fillets was really generous and tasted really well. It was served with tarter dip! I was really impressed with the food, and now that we can get the coastal flavors  here in Hyderabad, is a pure bliss! Ratings - 4.5/5.

Value for Money
=============
Hmm, its a very important point! Is the food served, worth the price? Absolutely yes! My bill was just around a thousand bucks for the amazing dinner, and I am not complaining! Ratings - 4/5.

Lets calculate,

Rating = (Ambiance + Service + Food + VFM)/4 = 4.375

Final Thoughts

============= 
If you love live music, Goan shack kinda experience and good sea food, then its a must visit! Probably one of the best place to chill out in Hyderabad.",4,"32 Reviews , 70 Followers",5/20/2019 10:28,5,
The Fisherman's Wharf,Pratiksha Sable,Visited this place about a month ago and they weren't very accommodating as we had our 5 month old baby with us which led us to walk out ASAP. They were relatively low on customer service with us but no complaints about the food. Tried the fish&chips and prawn curry with rice last week and was decent.,2,1 Review,5/20/2019 10:22,0,
The Fisherman's Wharf,Deepak Raj,"One of the best fine dining restaurant in Hyderabad . Superb ambiance and great service. I personally loved the place and the way they treat .

Tried spring roll, Tempura squid ,Drums of heaven and fish nam prik pao. Fish tasted awesome. Overall starters were great and you will not be disappointed.

Coming to main course ,tried mixed veg pulao and Dak bungalow chicken. Pulao could have been better. One more problem is you need to pay for raita or gravy to go with pulao.

Overall one will enjoy the ambiance and food. Better to have a reservation during weekends.

The Fisherman's Wharf,Sawan Suman,"Goan themed restaurant with great picturesque view and vastly spread. Great place to chill all around the day. The price is a bit on the higher side.
Ordered Zafrani Paneer tikka , amritsari fish tikka and butter garlic prawns for starters. Fish tikka was okayish, paneer nice and the prawns were delicious.
Tried thai green chicken curry with Jasmine rice for main course along with butter/garlic naan, daal tadka and paneer butter masala. Loved the thao curry.
They offer multiple options in cocktails and mocktails, however the prices are a bit high on the pocket. Had the best long island ice tea till date.

The Fisherman's Wharf,Gautham Maheswaran,"Goan food at its best! This place is as good as it's sister outlet in Goa. Mimicking the Goan ambience, this place is breezy and beautiful for an evening dining experience.

The food had great flavours, brilliantly cooked juicy prawns and the coconut sambol like side just tingle your taste buds. The southern fish fry and masala fried prawns are a delight! Great lighting and courteous staff.

Tried the south indian fish curry and rice. Probably not the best I've had, but all the other dishes made up for this.

Must try: masala fried prawns, kadhai jhinga, mutton xacuti, pinwheel delight (mushrooms)

There were numerous starters and it was very good. the starters actually make you full. The waiters were very friendly and helpful. they had asked multiple times for the starters to be repeated. the main course was good and there was a huge spread there. the best part was the desserts which were awesome.

Food:5/5 (why 3/5 in the main review then??)
Ambience: 5/5
Courtesy and staff: 1/5
Zomato gold experience: 1/5

When we reserve table, we expect to get the seat preference. I booked the table for 2 with seat preference as Outdoor seating. The issue was the lady who was attending us directly said that you've booked indoor seating, when i did show the details about my booking then she said ""Outdoor seating cannot be reserved"". If this is the case can you guys please update the same in your page. Disappointed.

Finally after the discussion, we decided to sit on the upper floor with a good view, since Outdoor seating cannot be reserved even with the prior booking. Moving on lets go to food.

Ambience: The entire olace has goan vibe to it. The area is huge and there is a lot space between tables. The sections are divided into shack like structures named after the beaches in Goa.

Drinks: LIIT, one of the best LIITs I had in Hyderabad. The lime mint juice was also tasty.

Food: Ordered beef chilly fry. The tenderness of the meat was perfect. Spice level, presentation was worth the price. They have ""as per size"" menu for their specialities such as lobsters, prawns, Pomfret. We had chose the butter garlic tiger prawns. Again, the presentation and the taste was class apart. The spice balance was fantastic.

Now comes the worst zomato gold experience.

Before ordering as you woukd expect, i unlocked my zomato gold, which means the lowest priced dish is complimentary (beef chilly fry in my case, since it was lower priced among the two).

The guy who served us didn't come with the bill. Another guy came up, saying we cannot give you the lower priced dish as complementary, because ""as per size"" menu is not included in the zomato gold. Which means you have to pay for everything!!!

This was never mentioned anywhere, neither it was informed to us by the guy who served us amd later camouflaged somewhere.

We had to pay for the entire bill, irrespective of the zomato gold because of unawareness of the staff.

Later ordered one more dish as a take away, which was made complementary.

If potion size and value for money is what you're looking for then this olace is not for you. If you're a sea food lover and want goan ambience in Hyderabad, then thumbs up.

The Fisherman's Wharf,Moonis Ahmed,"Went here for lunch with friends given this was near our place. Had heard rave reviews so decided to give it a try. 

During lunchtime, the place had few patrons but the service was good. We took an outside seating. 

Ordered a nachos platter, chicken drums of heaven, tawa murg khatta pyaz and kadhai chicken. Accompanied with butter naan.

The nachos were crisp and came with delicious toppings of salsa and cream cheese. The chicken dishes were delicious and each had its own distinct taste. The chicken pieces themselves were quite chunky and juicy. We really liked chicken drums of heaven with its crunchy outer covering from the batter and juicy inside. 

Overall, the dishes were a must try. With a large menu and varieties, I know I'll be coming back here again for sure to try their signature fish, prawns, and lobster fare.

The Fisherman's Wharf,Nawaz Mohammed,"This is my third visit to the restaurant and surely im going again. It's a huge restaurant with very spacious seating...they have outdoor seating, indoor seating, bar area,buffet area, roof top area its pretty huge place..and every bit of the restaurant is amazing.. Ambiance is spot on...waiters dress code is good too. Service is amazing. They have perfect knowledge of what they are serving..and always ready to help dinners. Hospitality is awesome. But Only one washroom is a mehüôÑ
Coming to the food..i tried many dishes like thai green curry,butter garlic fried rice, stuffed crab, fish and chips, alfredo pasta, cheez garlic bread.
I order thai curry every time I go..it comes with rice.. its creamy and fresh but the only reason i gave 4 star is they lack consistency...it tasted different all three times i tried.. It was good but different. Consistency matters!
Stuffed crab is amazing...overall must visit resturant. Its a expansive one but worth the visit..! I sujest night times around 7 is a good time to go.",4,"29 Reviews , 67 Followers",4/6/2019 10:18,3,
The Fisherman's Wharf,StomachFull/Fool,This place has good ambiance but i had a weird experience with food. The menu drums of heaven mentioned chicken wings but we were served drumsticks instead. Upon enquiring the respective guy tried to convince us the drum sticks are drums of heaven. When we had to show him menu and explained the difference for crying out loud he said there is a mistake in menu and went. Next u guys be the judge.,3,"5 Reviews , 51 Followers",4/5/2019 19:49,2,

The ambience is something you can get no where in Hyderabad. A Goan themed restaurant with a bar attached has wide variety of sea food and the typical desserts of the west coast too. It is slightly expensive but it is totally worth the money. The look and feel takes you the coast and away from the city and all the noise. This place is for friends, family and your loved ones. They have good variety of appetisers. Their service is very friendly. They do have valet and ample parking space.

The meat perfectly cooked and aromatic gravy. The goan prawn curry was a delight too. Mocktails were beautifully blended with flavour. The place has a kids play area too with those with children.

The Fisherman's Wharf,Shishir,"Fisherman's wharf used to be our fav joint when we lived in Goa. Excellent food and bevs.
Then we moved to Hyderabad, FMW followed.
We were so happy, to have a Goan restaurant just 5 min drive from home.
In the beginning it was great place to dine. Then it started getting local. Fishes started getting stale, fewer varieties ..Not so great.
Now , after about 3 years, it's more a typical curry point.
We ordered Mutton Xacuti and Kingfish Richado.
Fish was so firm and overcooked, richado overloaded with sweetness.
Mutton was out of the world, with heaps of Curry leaves(Kadi patta/Karia paku) , super high on heat....Reminded me of a Rayala curry in Dindi (Godavari distt ). Meat was cooked with extra affection that it took me 5 min to chew it like a bubblegum. I really thank myself for not ordering more.

Thereafter, we decided to wait for 15 mins as we are already head over heels by then. The food and drinks were commensurate to the hype and totally satiated our buds.

I have always been here for the love for 2 things. Crabs and only crabs. It is a must try speciality of the restaurant. The Goan preparation made with recheado masala.would rate that as the best as after eating that it will look like you have been feeding on blood as your hands and mouth would look bloodied.
