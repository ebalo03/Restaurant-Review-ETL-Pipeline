Driven Cafe,Gautam Narang,"We went to have coffee at this place. They have such awesome ambience. Coffee was fantastic and Mushroom, Corn and Jalape√±o Pizza was out of this world. Plus you can actually book Sports Bikes and Cars from this place. And if you have the moolah can take Lamborghini for a ride. I‚Äôm going for 4/5 for this hell of a place.",4,"16 Reviews , 82 Followers",5/24/2019 20:19,1,
Driven Cafe,Bharti Mehta,"Driven is a bike themed cafe where you can even take bikes or luxury cars for rent

This is located in the busiest IT areas of Hyderabad. This is one of the places that is open till late night in this area.

Though the food is good here but certainly overpriced.

Their cold coffee is really good but the brownies need to be a little soft.",3,"84 Reviews , 387 Followers",4/30/2019 22:01,0,

Driven Cafe,Shivi Saxena,"I am not a big fan of sports bikes, but I totally loved the place.
The interior and lightening is really soothing.
I preferred sitting on the first floor as it gave a better view of the place.
For food, we ordered a chilli garlic toast, chocolate donut with Mocha Frappe and Vanilla Frappe.

Individual Rating:
Food: (4/5) the donut was not upto the mark
Service : (5/5) It's self service, but my order was ready in like 5 minutes
Pocket Friendly : (4/5) The portion size was really small for the money they were charging
Ambiance : (4/5)

Driven Cafe,The Food O‚ÄôClock,"I love this place. Perfect place to have coffee atleast for me. Spacious, evergreen english songs eg Nirvana, Bryan Adams, on the back ground. It is just a perfect cafe where u can just sit, talk, sip coffee, enjoy the background songs, not a noisy cafe like some other cafes. This cafe is definitely going to be my new favourite in the city.

But the negative point is that they don‚Äôt have much items on the food menu which is why I gave only 3star.

Recommended if you care the ambiance and coffee more than the food items.",3,"26 Reviews , 13 Followers",2/14/2019 21:13,2,

They had a widespread authentic menu.And since we were very hungry,we ordered almost every thing.And all of the items left us craving for more.
You would find plethora of coffee. It is paradise for a black coffee person.The way they present their dishes,and the way it tastes is something you wouldnt get anywhere else in the country.You are the best,Driven cafe.You have my heart.

Driven Cafe,Farhad Tarapore,"The first thing that strikes you about the place is the ambience. You have a triumph thunderbird LT on one side with it's massive round headlights and a ducati monster on the other side in a dashing red. There's great music playing and there's riding gear, etc. hanging off the walls with numbers to call in case you want to rent some of it. 
I went in early morning around 8:30. The cleaning lady was still sweeping and it was kinda hot inside (ac switched off probably). There was no one behind the counter. Asked the cleaning lady and she shouted out for someone who came right away and took my order. 

Ordered for a mint mocha and a cinnamon roll. The guy was coughing randomly (hopefully not into my food or drink), but I found this to be an annoyance. I mean, you can have the fanciest of ambience but if the people who serve there aren't trained in basic hygiene and cleanliness, it all goes to waste. 

The mint mocha was superb and the cinnamon roll was ok-ish. As I paid, I got a torn note, so I gave it back (to exchange it of course). Instead the guy just took it and went away. I waited for a while, then called out. Asked for my money and instead of one note, he handed over two. The dude was clearly in his sleep - probably having been through the night shift.

Giving the rating only for ambience and quality of food. 1 point taken away for the serving attendant.

Driven Cafe,Kulsum Begum,"I was here with my bunch of friends a few days ago. I was in awe with this place and I guess anyone who visits here would also be, by the beautiful big toys this place has. From luxurious cars to super sexy sports bike, anything you want to rent this place has.
Coming to the food, they don‚Äôt have much variety, it‚Äôs just pizza, pasta, sandwich and desserts. We had ordered veg pizza- loved it, loaded with cheese and veggies with super thin crust. Four cheese pizza- I didn‚Äôt like it that much, made up of four types of cheese with super thin crust. Veg sandwich- nailed it, it was the most yummiest one for me. Paneer sandwich- my friends loved it, I don‚Äôt eat paneer so I can‚Äôt say that for myself. White sauce pasta- it was good, more veggies to it would have made it perfect for me.
Coming to drinks, I ordered cool blue slush and I loved it taste wise , another reason being, it took too long to sipped up fully.
Overall, it was a good experience for me.",4,"41 Reviews , 67 Followers",11/24/2018 13:10,3,

Driven Cafe,Charushila Biswas,"Super fancy ambience and cost but totally not worth the hype. We ordered:
‚ñ™Mint mocha - which tasted OK
‚ñ™Chocolate bomb - tasted like crushed oreos with butter and meagre amount of chocolate.
‚ñ™Mushroom sandwich - overpriced for this ccd type sandwiche.
‚ñ™coffee crunch - it was good because I like chocolate and coffee combo. But for the price, the drink itself not that rich.
Few good points:
‚ñ™vegetarian cafe
‚ñ™good location
‚ñ™good music
‚ñ™they buzz you when your food's ready

All I can say is (and I am saying this because I believe that everything can get better if you put effort) Driven Cafe... dont drive us away with your bad food. We dont mind paying a bomb if the food is excellent. And your selling point is NOT the Ambience. You dont have a selling point if your quality of food is so low. There's so much competition out there, you have to rev-up your game.

This place is known for its rusty garage-like interiors, where you can rent some top notch automobiles.

Unfortunately, I was disappointing with the Cappuccino. Tried a 'medium' Cappuccino - which is a double expresso shot coffee with foamed milk, and it was very underwhelming. No aroma, no kick, it was very bland and generic. Had a hard time getting through it. 
The wife tried Frappe, which was as per her taste and my daughter (who has a major sweet tooth) found her choco chip brownie nice. However, I was quite disappointed overall.",3,"5 Reviews , 114 Followers",9/17/2018 10:51,0,

I‚Äôve tried the cafe mocha,mint mocha- strong minty flavour, hot chocolate: all equally good. The snacks are quite average and can be avoided. The chilli cheese toast is a disappointment.

The ambience stands out from all the nearby places, with whole garage theme. If you look closely the tables on first floor are actually made up on car and truck parts as well! Too much innovation and thinking, is just mind blowing. The wall next to stairs full of pictures is most photogenic. The cherry on top is their songs selection.

All the coffees taste great, especially the fact you get it even after midnight. Although my personal favourites are Flat white and Cappuccino. The quite bites available as Paneer Kulcha is recommended as well. 

Don't forget to take good camera along with you while going here.",5,"60 Reviews , 319 Followers",6/29/2018 16:17,4,
Driven Cafe,Shiva Chary,"What catches your eyes could be the expensive Cars and Super Bikes (which you could rent), but once you enter inside the place - you have to flex your muscles to push the door which has a heavy chain- you get a good feeling. The place offers you some interesting food options to choose from and the garage feeling gives a huge rush. The antique furniture at places adds some uniqueness to the conversation.. must visit for quick friendly hangout..",4,"19 Reviews , 64 Followers",6/29/2018 12:34,4,

Driven Cafe,Harsh Jhunjhunwala,"Great place to hangout and chill with friends. We just went for a drive around 12.30 and ended up here !
The ambience was pretty cool !
We tried garlic bread, with brownie and a cold coffee !
Brownie was little disappointing i would say, too sweet !
Though Coffee was pretty good !
Garlic bread was ok , it could have been little more crisp !
Will definately like to try out once more with pizzas and pasta !",3,"126 Reviews , 337 Followers",6/12/2018 9:47,5,
Driven Cafe,ChicLifeByte,"If bikes, cars and coffee are your weaknesses then the Driven Cafe is no less than heaven for you. Their luxurious collection of supercars and bikes includes fantabulous FORD-MUSTANG-5, premium PORSCHE-911 CARRERA-4S0, the Hulk of Bikes TRIUMPH-ROCKET-III, speedy SUZUKI-HAYABUSA and the kinetic KAWASAKI-ZX14R- which is also one of the world‚Äôs fastest bike to name a few and guess what one could also rent these amazing creations from their website. At present, their fleet consists of 150 cars, 50 motorcycles and 7 bicycles.

If this doesn‚Äôt satisfy the gearhead inside you then there‚Äôs some delicious food and coffee for killing your hunger cravings even in those odd hours of the night!

The place is a brilliant amalgamation of a cafe and a bike museum. The ground floor of this establishment is a quaint cafe which sells food and beverages. It is very vintage in feel and decor and you will be treated by a very well spoken staff. The cafe also has a store which sells/rents biking accessories including biking jackets, helmets and other accessories.

Coming to the food now, the first thing we had here was the Chili Cheese Toast which is a cheddar melt on white bloomer with an orange mayo. It was quite filling and really tasty. Next up was the flavourful Apple Pie with ice-cream that totally melted in mouth and tasted heavenly with ice-cream.

This was complemented with a selfie coffee and a regular coffee. The ‚Äòselfie coffee‚Äô has your selfie printed on the coffee foam purely made of edible ink. This is one-of-a-kind experience. You click a selfie and Whatsapp that on a number, they‚Äôll print that particular selfie on the coffee.

Lastly we had the Turkish Baklava Twins which were crunchy, nutty, flaky and really delicious. The place has a lot of variety in terms of coffee which included Colombian Coffee, Death Wish, Illy Monka, Birch Coffee, Araku Tribal Coffee, Organic Decaf Peppermint Mocha and many more.

The place is definitely a must go!

Driven Cafe,Nishu,"Explored this place today and was surprisingly very good because it never occurred me to try out for this long. Has an American cafe ambiance and feel and is open until 1 AM at least. The cheese garlic bread, veg puffs and Latte coffee were pretty good. It's self service and the order came in pretty quick. One and only suggestion is that maybe they can focus a little more on cleanliness. Overall, a good place for a quick catch up with friends over a bite.

Driven Cafe,Siva Kumar,"Well been to this place for 4 times now, the reason being it's unique ambience, peace and the opportunity nto spend quality time.

Would have given it a 5 but the place has lost a bit of it's charm recently.

Shakes are very good, my personal favorite being black currant..n the brownie is also super yummy.

The main attraction would always be the awesome interiors which this place offers.

Driven Cafe,Sayir Ashai,"Visited on 3rd June 18. The place is cool and the deserts served here are really nice.

I tried the Mango Pie, chocolate donut and the chilli bread and the cold coffee.

Mango pie was pretty good and the blueberry muffin was really tasty.

Frappe coffee was an average cold coffee but Chilli cheese bread was a different one.

The ambiance and the music is cool. Good place to hangout and get some nice time with friends with a cup of coffee.",4,"15 Reviews , 12 Followers",6/4/2018 2:40,0,
