Absolute Sizzlers,Arun Sharma,"Service was pathetic. Ordered a sizzler with lamb, was told no lamb. Ordered another sizzle with Noodles. It took 15 mins to serve that one. Also, served it with rice instead and when I asked to change, they gave me a noodle differently and that too since they were irritated with lots of chilli sauce. I sweated through first 5 mins and then just left the sizzler as such.

No apologies, nothing from there side. When asked for manager, told me he is not here.

Prakash was not helpful or apologetic, he just denied that he never served it.
Benjamin still was apologetic about the whole goofup.",2,"7 Reviews , 64 Followers",5/21/2019 21:45,2,

Absolute Sizzlers,Raju,"When we first tried, that was 8months back.. the food taste and the quantity was good. Now they seems very much focused on offers not the quantity and quality of food. Very disappointed on my next two visits;They started reducing the quantity of the main dish in their Sizzlers, seems now the main dish is just for topping to attract.",3,"10 Reviews , 3 Followers",5/18/2019 9:18,0,
Absolute Sizzlers,Ravi Yogesh,"Visited for lunch today with colleagues and ordered one spicy chicken sizzler combo and two buffets. The buffet comes with veg and non veg sizzler , though without the sides (fries, veggies and noodles/rice). The buffet was decent though not great wrt variety and taste but the sizzler combo left us impressed with very good portions , perfectly cooked fresh chicken fillets loaded with veggies and garlic sauce. Would recommend the sizzler combo over the buffet.",4,"161 Reviews , 201 Followers",5/17/2019 20:00,5,

Absolute Sizzlers,Jagan Jrb,"I went here earlier some time back and was really impressed. Loved the sizzlers.. so I recommended it for a team lunch. They preferred buffet, so instead of going for different kinds of sizzlers, we went ahead with the buffet. The most disappointing part was , despite a reservation for 12:30 pm, nothing was served till 12:55.
No body even looked at the table, as they did not want to even respond. We can accept a delay but negligence is not acceptable. We had to go back to them and ask for water and keep inquiring when the food would be ready.
Finally they served and none of us liked the food. All they could relish was coke and gulab jamun.
Even if the food was not good, I would not give such rating. But the service is very disappointing.
If If there is an issue, we would be glad to understand the reason for delay. But being rude and ignoring when we are at a restaurant was least expected.
Don‚Äôt think I would go back there again.",1,"5 Reviews , 50 Followers",5/17/2019 16:29,0,

The server was rude, unpolite and refused to accept his mistakes and even manager to the same extent. There is no proper communication between chef and server.

Absolute Sizzlers,Parijat Ray,"We had a very bad experience here. We have ordered Fish Shashilk and Sizzling Chicken sizzlers. The Fish Shashilk sizzler didn't have fish in it. Upon asking the waiter, he started searching the fish in my sizzler and was trying to make sure that I had already not eaten it. He then brought a grilled fish fillet and said that the sizzler can't be remade because the kitchen was quite busy. Upon arguing, another person came and changed my sizzler. I had visited this restaurant with lots of expectations as sizzlers are one of my favorites. Mistakes can happen anytime anywhere. It's an urge from side that please behave properly with the customers.

I would have given one star. But one extra star for the person who bothered to bring me a new sizzler.",2,"146 Reviews , 333 Followers",4/8/2019 23:54,1,

While the food they serve is good but they could do better with service.
Service isn‚Äôt up to the mark , once your order is taken it‚Äôs lost somewhere until it really arrives at your table (after 20 mins ) and once the food is at your table the waiter will never show up again to ask if you need anything else or how‚Äôs the food??!!.

I would suggest revamping this particular recipe with lesser no. of vegetables (maybe cut the bell peppers and baby corn out). Also, the ""smoked chicken"" needs to be upgraded.

Absolute Sizzlers,Sohini Chakraborty,"We went for lunch and ordered two sizzlers, veg and non veg. Both were not up to the mark. Taste was not good and portion size was less. Not enough veggies in the dish. But one good thing I liked the ambience. Need to improve loads on the taste part",1,"9 Reviews , 60 Followers",3/12/2019 14:31,0,

Absolute Sizzlers,Mani Jha,"I have had high expectations of food there but then my green salad with mint sauce was not very good. While the chicken wings I ordered were nice, but they ruined the American Chopsuey. It was more like eating a soupy noodles than a Chopsuey. I wish they would have made that better.
