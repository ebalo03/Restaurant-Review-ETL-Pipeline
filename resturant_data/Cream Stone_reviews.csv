Cream Stone,Priya ‡∞™‡±ç‡∞∞‡∞ø‡∞Ø‡∞æ,"I am wondering if I had ordered thick shake or an ice cream.. thick shake will have better consistency than this.. most of my previous orders were in the same condition, yet I gave them 3 or 4 star considering the reputation of the brand .. NOT ANY MORE. Spending 150+ on something like this is utter waste.. IF YOU GUYS COULDN'T PROVIDE ICE CREAM IN PROPER WAY THEN PLEASE STOP GIVING HOME DELIVERY.. despite of the fact that there is hell lot of dry ice in the package the ice cream came was in that manner. I wonder if I can actually call this as an ice cream. Some times u guys forget to keep dry ice and sometimes the ice cream gets completely melted ..... NOT SATISFIED with your ice cream. . Not worth spending a single rupee on this one.

I was trying to take a pic and then this happened. I didn't keep pressure while holding. You can understand how liquid the consistency is just by looking at the picture. I didn't had a single spoon of ice cream from it and not a single drop of it fell out. Both quantity n quality was not good. I understand that ice cream melts but not at this rate. I place was less than a km away and delivery guy can reach in just 3 minutes.

The ambiance is good and they have a seating arrangement for about 15 peoples.

I tried the Red Velvet and Willy Wonka Icecreams. They are served on a cone which is also very crispy.
Willy Wonka is made from Chocolate, brownies, and nuts and it was amazing and so was the red velvet one. One ice cream is too heavy for a single person so try accordingly.
