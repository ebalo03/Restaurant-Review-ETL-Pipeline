Domino's Pizza,Upasana Motani,"I have ordered from Dominos all my life, but no store has ever been this bad.
The order arrived in 45 mins, all my food had completely cooled down.
I asked the delivery boy about their 30 mins policy, and he gave a very casual answer saying ""ma'am parking me late hogya, jaane do"" I tried to argue saying that its not my problem and he agreed to give me a 300 rs refund. I asked him to do it at the moment and he said, his manager is busy so it cant be done right now but he assured me that it will be done. 

I talked to his manager on the phone, and he completely denied my refund. 
He didn't care about customer service, he talked very rudely, and he said he's not going to follow the policy. He also said I don't care if you accept the order or return it.
(If this was the case, why did the delivery boy ensure my refund and tried to run off?)

People like this don't deserve to be a part of DOMINOS.
They're completely ruining the franchise image.",1,3 Reviews,5/18/2019 3:00,0,

Domino's Pizza,Vaibhav Singh,Worst experience at dominos. No air conditioner at the store is working (out of 5). It was too hot. No one cared about it. It took too long to get the tables cleaned.,1,"2 Reviews , 45 Followers",5/12/2019 20:42,0,
Domino's Pizza,Krishna,I ordered pizza with extra cheese but there is no extra cheese in it. I cant imagine dominos can do such a pathetic job. I am totally dissatisfied,1,1 Review,5/11/2019 13:48,0,
Domino's Pizza,Farhaan Nasir (bankruptfoodie),"Domino's doesn't live up to the standards any more. I ordered a pizza and it was late with a delivery time of 1hour with a promised delivery of 30 Mins. Once I got the pizza it was smashed.. When asked for a refund they said they will give me ""Domino's"" credits. However I didn't get the credits as well. Also I don't want domino's credits. I want my money back. I will never order from dominos again and would advise that they shut down at least this store since they are not able to live up to the standards.

Domino's Pizza,Sundranipinky,"Pathetic experience
Never order from this outlet
They neither deliver the order nor refund your money
I ordered at around 9pm from this outlet and waited till 11 i never received my food
Also all the help line numbers they provide are either wrong or not reachable

Domino's Pizza,Moonis Ahmed,"Ordered a pizza, garlic bread and other stuff on 14th Feb at 9 pm through Zomato. ZOMATO shows order is in the kitchen. But no call, no delivery even by 10.15 pm. The branch number on Zomato was incorrect. Called up Dominos hotline and they said they'll reach out to the branch and they'll call back. Waited for 15 min. No call back. Called the hotline again and the guy puts me on hold while he reaches out to the branch. 5 min later i am disconnected. Called up again and the same message that they will reach out to the branch is thrown on my face. Finally had it enough and asked them to cancel my order and refund the money.

I anyway don't eat Dominos pizza given some pretty bad prior experience. But ordered on my wife's insistence. Congratulations. Now even my wife doesn't want to order Dominos ever again. :)

1. Zomato doesn't have any view on what the restaurant is doing with the order. The system automatically said food is being prepared when clearly the restaurant has no clue on the order.

2. Dominos hotline is worthless. No clue on if their branch actually has a working phone or not.",1,"160 Reviews , 754 Followers",2/15/2019 14:31,0,

Domino's Pizza,BE Happiee,It is waste to order pizza from this restaurant. I forgot that I have preferred a cheese burst pizza. There is no cheese in pizza and moreover the diameter of uttappam is far better than this pizza. I will never prefer this,1,"1 Review , 1 Follower",1/4/2019 11:00,0,
