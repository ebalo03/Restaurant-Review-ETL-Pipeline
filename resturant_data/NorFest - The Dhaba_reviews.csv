NorFest - The Dhaba,Ajit Kumar,Are you bored taking North Indian foods from South Indian restaurant? Then you must try the limited yet handcrafted North Indian cuisines in Norfest which is rapidly increasing its presence in the city.

NorFest - The Dhaba,Atanu Ray,"Well this is the first time I ordered from NorFest - The Dhaba. I ordered for mutton combo meal which contains rice, dal makhani, 2 paratha and mutton with a pocket pinch of Rs. 400. However, very disappointed with the quantity of food. At that price range they are not providing a proper portion . Moreover the mutton was well cooked but out of 4 small pieces, 2 of them had bones and no meat . Kindly donot deceive your customers like this with good packaging . I gave three star only for the quality .",3,"1 Review , 1 Follower",2/24/2019 22:35,0,
NorFest - The Dhaba,Pratikr,i ordered punjabi chicken and my experience was horrible. Such a costly thing of rs 300 and such less quantity that hardly one person can eat. The food too was not fresh and was stale and was smelling. had to throw it away and neither zomato nor these ppl lsitened to any queries.

NorFest - The Dhaba,Hayavadan Rao / The DeccanFoodie,A really good meal at a reasonable price. The quantity was perfect. Not a lot and not too less. I ordered the paneer combo and shikanji . Norfest dhaba has probably one of the best packaging materials. Looking at the box itself I started feeling more hungry. The only part in the meal that disappointed me was the shikanji.

NorFest - The Dhaba,Vivek Jain,"The place is located in the food court of SLN Terminus and the first branch of Norfest in the city. The seating is in the food court and the kiosk has the dhaba feel with copper vessels on the counter containing the frequent items like rice and chole.

As it was winter we were fortunate to have Makki ki Roti and Sarson ka Saag. The Makki ki Roti was a bit thick served with homemade white butter or makhan, Saag was good but lacked salt in it. The flavor was decent mix of sarson and garlic peices in it.

The next thing was Amritsari Kulcha and Chole, a must try and must have at Norfest. The Kulcha alone is sufficient to fill one person, the chole along with it might be a bit less but they do refill. The taste of the Kulcha is great but if your luck is bad you can get a less filled kulcha as well. The Chole is the perfect compliment to it and tastes good.

The final dish was the Paneer Lababdaar and Garlic Naan, the curry again lacked salt, and was not upto the mark in terms of taste. So overall not recommended.

NorFest - The Dhaba,Arvind Ramachander ( Fb.com/Sooperclicks ),"Lunch at Norfest, Gachibowli.
I'm a big fan of this place and love their combos.
Ordered their Veg. Galouti Kebab which comes with a paratha underneath and the mint chutney.
Was mast mast, would have loved it to be a little more well done though.

Then came the Veg. Combo - Had 2 butter rotis with Mixed Veg curry (Corn, carrot, Peas, capsicum, potato, Aloo, onion mix ) + basmati rice and daal makhani.
Absolutely loved the mixed Veg curry and roti combo and daal makhani was very makhan makhani üòÅ with very little daal, but tasty nonetheless üòä

Norfest is now operational in PVR Galleria, Punjagutta hence becomes more closer to my location üòä

Their Paratha combos are also a strong recommendation.

üç± Punjabi Non veg thali is perfectly packed meal box from saladü•ó to raita.

üçõ In a non-veg thali veg curries definitely need no mention but no one can ignore dal makhani. Wake up the dal makhani by stirring it as all the dal sunks to the bottom and sleeps. Felt it can be a bit thicker in consistency.

ü•òButter chicken was so delicious and mild in spicies(‚úîÔ∏è).

NorFest - The Dhaba,Surya,"Ordered today veg thali via Uber eats. Was reading reviews and expected it to be nice. On the contrary, it was a pathetic experience. Below item wise feedback:
Butter roti- made full of maida and instead of butter, it seems like used edible oil was recycled for these so called rotis. They should call it a naan actually
Salad- carrot was rotten and not too sure who asked you to provide them anyways
Paneer - it is so much stale and so hard to chew. Am sure it has exceeded it's expiry date.
Dal makhani - this was good and loved it. (The only.item in entire meal which I liked)
Mix vegetable - it's only beans with gravy which tastes awful
Mix raita - while the curd part was good, the boondi used was really so stale and it tastes like grease.

I wondered by looking the quantity of items. They are very small quantity. 
Taste of the food is ok, not as read in the reviews it is not great. In non veg spl thali they are providing 2 peach chicken in the gravy, that is spl non veg thali, great joke. VFM 1/5.  
They are not providing drinking water. A eatery/restaurant should provide the drinking water.
I have axis bank card with that they should give 15% disount, when ordering they denied it, after completing the food and went once again by showing him on the mobile that your restaurant is on the webiste, then they gave 10% discount after arguing, they should give 15%.",1,"28 Reviews , 64 Followers",9/15/2018 15:01,0,
NorFest - The Dhaba,Rubin S Cherian,"This has been on my list for a while now, but for some reason, hadn't been able to make it there until recently. Went in for Lunch with my colleagues. Was impressed by the level of activity at this place, serving huge nos of online orders from a rather small kitchen (housed in a food court).

We ordered Mutton Galouti Kebab, Veg Seekh Kebab, Paneer Kadhai, Butter chicken, Dal Tadka, Tandoori Rotis and Jeera Rice. The Mutton Kebab was delicious - the 'melt in the mouth and leave you wondering' kind - only possible improvement was that they could have made it a bit less salty - strictly nitpicking.

The veg seekh Kebab arrived slightly late and was not as good as the Mutton, but still held a good taste. The star for us was the Butter chicken. Slightly tangy, moderately spicy, slightly sweet, incredibly smooth and buttery, with huge pieces of chicken. I was bowled over..! So impressed was I, that the Paneer kadhai, which was actually more than decent and very tasty, failed to capture my attention..! The Dal and the rotis were good, but paled in comparison with the magic of that Butter chicken. The only less impressive dish among the lot was the Jeera rice, which was almost devoid of all flavours except salt - could have been better.

In all, a very good experience. I cant say Value for money, but the food was impressive in general. Worth more visits, any day..! Thanks.

NorFest - The Dhaba,Fit Foodie,"Have been to this place and also ordered from here. This place serves one of the best Awadhi and Punjabi dishes in Hyderabad. This is located in the food court of SLN Terminus mall. Loved their butter chicken which went really well with Tandoori Roti. Galouti kebab was awesome as well and went really well with the paratha served.

Ordered Lucknowi dum pulao veg as well as Chicken today. Portion size for both was a little on the lower side. The flavors and taste were awesome. As soon as the food was in the house we could smell Awadhi cooking. They serve Boondi Raita with the pulao, this is a welcome break from the onion - tomato Raita that usually comes with Biryani.

NorFest - The Dhaba,Roohi Najiya,"‚ö´Ô∏è This has to be my favourite Punjabi restaurant in Hyderabad!!! During my short trip in Hyderabad,I have tried food in many restaurants but this one was a scene stealer!! What I liked the most abt this place was the amazing food at such a reasonable price!!!
The taste was something that will crave you to have more and more even when you are full!!!
I visited this place with my friend without any proper planning.. our intention was to visit the pub in the same mall but we were too hungry and were not interested in eating in pub!! We wanted something heavy to get that energy to dance like crazy üíÉüíÉ
So, we ended up in this restaurant!! It is located at the food court and has open seating facility!!!
.
.
üî¥We ordered the Punjabi Special VegThali:
‚Çπ269/-
It was the most delicious Thali I ever had in life, just divine and out of the world ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
It comprises of the following:
‚ñ™Ô∏èKadai Paneer (4.5/5)
Paneer are usually always tasty in most of the restaurants but the gravy always lacks the taste!! I have the habit of just eating the paneer cubes and leaving the gravy!!! But, this one has the most tasty and delicious gravyüëçüëç

‚ñ™Ô∏èDum aloo (4/5)
This was the veg of the day, potatoes ü•î were peeled properly and were marinated nicely!!! Just like paneer, the gravy was something to lure for!!

‚ñ™Ô∏èDal Makhani (4.5/5)
A Punjabi Thali is definitely incomplete without a Dal Makhani!!! It is one of the most popular and loved dal in the northern part of the country!! The dal gets its taste and richness from the use of cream and butter in black lentils and red kidney beans!! It was super yummy and definitely the best dal makhani I ever had!!

‚ñ™Ô∏èBundi Raita (5/5)
This one stole my heart ‚ù£ I think words won‚Äôt do justice for its great taste!! I never had such a tasty raita ever in any restaurant and trust me I eat out a lot!!! I would have mind having 3 bowls of raita at one go coz it was this yummy!! The curd was fresh and the minimum spices used in it was adding the perfect flavour... A big thumbs up for this dish üëçüëçüëç

‚ñ™Ô∏èRice (4/5)
The zeera basmati rice üçö was definitely of the best quality!! It was big in size and was cooked so well!! Each rice piece was looking like a gem on its own !!!

‚ñ™Ô∏èButter Tandoori Roti (4/5)
It was soft, buttery and definitely only made up of wheat üåæ without any hint of maida!!!

‚ñ™Ô∏èSalad (4.5/5)
Fresh cucumber ü•í, carrot ü•ï and onion with a pinch of lemon üçã is definitely makes the best salad in a Punjabi Thali üëçüëç

‚ñ™Ô∏èKheer (4/5)
The perfect way to end a meal is by having a sweet dish and what can be better than kheer!!! It was not overly sweet but the sugar was mixed in a way that will suit everyone!!!
.
.
‚ö´Ô∏è The service was quick and they did not made us wait for more than 15 mins!!! What I like most about the food was that the spices was added in a perfect way, just to make it tasty they have not turned it into super spicy!!!
The quantity is good for one person although even two person can share it!!! But, I will suggest not to share as it is so yummy and tasty, you will regret sharing even a single bite!!
Surely try this outlet and you will thank me later ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

NorFest - The Dhaba,Shreyoshi Mandal,"Okay to begin with, a 4.3 rated place in food court sounded quite fishy to me. So I was expecting a big bang surprise with their food. I had Amritsari Kulcha with Chole, Sweet Lassi and Shikanji.
First, coming to the people who spoke about ""Authentic Punjabi"" food in reviews, guys you are either out of your mind or really need to hit Punjab and eat there!
Shikanji was plain flavoured water that tasted medicinal, Lassi was the worst one I have had lately. The Amritsari Kulcha and Chole was tasteless. The dollop of ""Butter"" didnt taste as it was meant to.

NorFest - The Dhaba,Varun,"Have been there several times and have opted for delivery too.

They serve pretty good authentic North Indian food. Mutton Rogan Josh, Butter Chicken and Dal Makhni are top notch. Very flavorful and authentic.

Galaouti Kebabs are by far the best item in the menu.

Story goes that one particular Nawab of Lucknow, who was an infamous couch potato, had lost the use of his dentures and was looking for something pate style, which needed no chewing yet imparted the flavors of a fine kebab. So Galaouti‚Äòs were invented.

And the mutton Galaouti‚Äôs served here, are exactly like mentioned above. Very soft not much chewing required, they just melt in the mouth. They are served with ulta tawa paratha's and is a must must try.

Pricing is very economical and occasionally they offer 50% discount too over Uber eats.So, if u have a thing for North Indian cuisine it's a nice place to go.",4,"27 Reviews , 21 Followers",7/8/2018 1:36,0,

NorFest - The Dhaba,Avin Seth,"One of my favs for north india food in Hyderabad and within budget. The veg galauti kababs, amritsari kulcha with chole adds to the punjabi food. A nice small outlet in SLN terminus food court, run by punjabis and hence the punjabi taste in the food is what makes my inner punjabi come out and relish the cusine at this place.

Guys open more outlets in Hyderabad its would be a great success.

Tried Veg Dum Pulao, and Lassi also, nope...I can't even rate these items, they should remove these items from there menu.

Whenever I am hungry and I want to eat good Punjabi Food, this has been my go-to place in gachibowli. Recently a second outlet was opened in madhapur also.
I have tasted almost every item here, like paneer butter masala, matar mushroom, Dal makhni, Amritsari Kulcha with Chole, Lucknowi chicken dum pulav, murgh tikka masala, Punjabi special veg / non-veg Thali, rajma chawal etc.,
My best picks are matar mushroom, paneer butter masala, Punjabi special veg Thali, punjabi butter chicken to name a few.
I was disappointed with the Rajma chawal though.

The best thing about this place is its consistency in taste which it maintains.

I ordered a Chicken Dum Pulao and it was the best thing I ate in my 6 days stay at Hyderabad! Everything was properly cooked and tasted delicious. Though a little expensive, they were worth it. There were ample pieces of chicken.
Only things I‚Äôd complain about would be Pudina Chutney and the quantity of rice.

This is located on the 3rd floor of a mall (SLN Terminus), and you will have to dine in the common food court. Good food and the close proximity to IT companies attract a crowd. You can order online to avoid the rush.",5,"24 Reviews , 190 Followers",6/29/2018 2:08,0,

Coming to the food, we ordered paneer combo in which they serve paneer curry, rice, dal makhni and 2 roti. Quantity is sufficient for 1 person. The best part of the meal was their dal makhni. it was just wow. paneer curry was good in taste but it had little strong flavour of tadka.

I also had amritsari kulcha with chole. It was good in taste. Also, tried their lassi and sikanji. lassi was delicious but sikanji was totally opposite. It was not refreshing as it should be.

Overall, we had nice experience, and recommendable place to have food in SLN terminus.

NorFest - The Dhaba,Daenarys,"The spare get five in this judging world where every mere mortal, including me, set about while writing a review, scrutinize every bite we took and every sense we had.
On such a rare occasion, i commemorate this restaurant with invisible gardens and gold because it definitely is worth spending your hard earned me for a sensation like this.
Since the time i shifted to Hyderabad, i have had trouble finding the less is more concept in a restaurant.
Spicy, hot and tangy became a common thing. And here comes Norfest, like a strong and quiet gallant hero, who quietly watches the bustle in the world and only comes when called upon.

The mutton galauti kebabs took me back to the streets of husainganj in lko where, street food sellers scream in the humid heat, ushering people to come in to their food haven. It was soft and melting in your mouth and i didnt have to be physically placed in lko again. The nuts on top were a nice touch.

We also ordered for a non veg thali which had butter chicken and I, a slow eater, finished it in seconds. I still remember the taste in my mouth, tandoori chicken, soft and creamy gravy with warm rice.
The dal makhani, i presumed would have the sane taste as the butter chicken, but it had a more coherent flavor of the dal and solely made with the lentil and no rajma was added.
I, a pure non vegetarian, became a fan of the veggie curry with cooked capsicums, carrots and corn. The gravy enveloping it was amazing.
The thali was so well packed that nothing had spilled out and touched any other item when i opened it.
The kheer was the perfect stop for this sensations insued trip.
It was sweet, the rice had formed a beautiful serene sort of bond with the milk and the saffron gave it a nice fresh touch.
Talking about it, i am definitely reordering it tomorrow. Kudos",5,"115 Reviews , 4025 Followers",5/30/2018 1:03,0,
