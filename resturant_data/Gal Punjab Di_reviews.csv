Gal Punjab Di,Mitali Agrawal,"Food is good in taste. Specially the rotis are very soft and crispy. Kadhai paneer was okay, as it was not really a Kadhai paneer basically a paneer curry.

Gal Punjab Di,Sneha Battula,"Definitely worth a try if you're looking for some lip smacking North Indian Food.

Must try: Kadai Paneer, Garlic Naan, Shikari Murgh, Dum Ke Aloo, and Chicken Nachos.

Patiala Lassi is a must try as well but I wasn't too happy about it cause it didn't have much authenticity to it. It sure would be a game changer if they brought in some changes to it.",4,"76 Reviews , 860 Followers",5/14/2019 12:18,0,
Gal Punjab Di,Nikunj Keshav,"I went to this place for a lunch with my friend. We were the first one to land at the restaurant - sharp @12noon. Yeah! We were actually hungry. I liked the place - decoration was awesome! Cool interior. We ordered Veg Machaow Soup, Masala Papad, butter naan, Paneer Massallam and masala cold drinks. Please do note they give only Masala cold drink and not a regular cold col drink. We liked the food, taste was good. But the cold drink was tasteless - I guess it was already opened one so couldn't get the taste bar that everything was good. Ambiance was actually the best - decoration, the and ample space. But service could have been good and fast.

Food - 4/5
Ambiance - 5/5

Gal Punjab Di,Anupam Acharya,"We had ordered the Spicy Mutter paratha (2/5) and the Mooli paratha (3/5). The parathas were thick and there was no butter on them. It comes with a drink(3/5) and dal makhani(3/5). Now I am not a regular paratha eater but occasionally i love my aloo, gobi and mooli ke parathe. I have always ordered and found them to be good but this time i was disappointed. From the looks of the paratha, i am sorry to say this, but it didn't look very punjabi. Punjabis know their paratha well and wouldn't compromise on it. Cheers!",2,"207 Reviews , 400 Followers",5/5/2019 0:02,1,

Gal Punjab Di,Yash Sheth,"I visited this place with my friend. It is there right in the heart of Gachibowli's Indiranagar, vinayak nagar.

Upon entering, you will definitely feel good and like a family restaurant, which it is. The ambience is decent but its furniture are bit off. There are some corner sittings which many may or may not like and then there were chairs where fitting in was a bit tight.

Then comes the interaction with the staff. They are quite friendly and hard working too. They do have a quick serving time but thing is their attire was not up to the mark.

Menu had a wide variety of items and at some decent rates. I really liked the way they split between veg and non-veg food.

We ordered quite a lot of stuff but I really liked the dahi kebab. It was good. But with such good starter I had pinned my hopes on Patiala lassi. But that was an anti climax of sorts. They used essence for the lassi. I hope they start making more authentic lassi with a malai on top. That will surely be a game changer.

Overall... it was a mixed experience and hence 3/5.",3,"59 Reviews , 182 Followers",4/20/2019 17:19,3,

we opted for 599 unlimited menu. Gosh it has like so many items that you will get confused what to order. Main course was great, the butter chicken and mutton were cooked properly and tasted really amazing. However, the chicken starters were lil salty.

Service needs a lot of improvement. Service is really slow, but then the staff is really courteous.

Gal Punjab Di,Leher Sadhnani,"‚ÄùNai, They don‚Äôt have any punjabi Gal‚Äô

First things first, really not happy with their service. Two different groups of people who came after us were served earlier than us and another worst thing was Washrooms din have water supply and that created a big problem for most of the customers.

So finally we got our order after 20-25 min of wait. The lemon coriander soup was quite normal with dense eggy smell. In starters Amrutsari murg was nice with moderate flavours along with malai. This came with grated cheese on top of it which was the only best part. Methi roti was fresh and good which came with 2 pieces. Unlike plain tandoori tasted too bad, it was the flour which got stale over the time may be. Don‚Äôt know how they served it. So we ordered Boneless Murg, i guess it was Murg Musalam, this tastes really good just like as i needed less spicy, thick gravy and nice pieces of chicken.

Gal Punjab Di,Praveen Mokkapati,"Food tastes great for a quaint little place snuck in inner lanes of Gachibowli! The place is lively with Punjabi music and the friendly staff.

As vegans that eat food with little oil and spice, three of us had a sumptuous meal that comprised of Tandoori Aloo and Kebab as starters. The initial order of a different kebab was sent back as the chef didn't comply with our little/no spice request. Our order of Aloo Parantha and Veg Kolhapuri came as requested, however the Ajwain Laccha Parantha and Roti came laced with butter/ghee. The bread was replaced in 5 min or so as requested. Aloo Parantha Combo came along with raita and chole. We requested raita to be replaced with another serving of chole, and the staff gladly obliged.

Barring the few delays due to non-compliance of our requests, we found the food to be delightful, tasty and filling for a weekday dinner. The shikanji was great too! The staff are courteous, but definitely could do well with internal communication with the chef(s) to ensure requests are fulfilled. Go for it!",4,"1 Review , 14 Followers",3/12/2019 20:19,0,

Nizami handi was very rich, heavy but very tasty. It could have more balanced mix of vegetables and cream gravy. dont go by the photo, taste was good.

Mushroom manchurian is something i have never had before, tasted like manchurian. Personally still prefer good ol manchurian. Can definitively try if you have not eaten before..bit meaty in taste!

For main course: Aloo onion paratha, amritsari kulcha and judwa paneer. 4/5
One plate of paratha/kulcha is enough for one person the side serving are also good in taste. Judwa paneer was also good.

Gal Punjab Di,Va Hini,Been to this place a couple of times and enjoyed decent food. But my last visit to this place disappointed me a bit. Tried in starters sheela ka shashlik fish in starters. Little more marination could have enhanced the flavour of dish. Butter chicken which was ordered more didn't meet the taste buds. The chicken seems to be not that fresh and tasted more like paneer. The only dish which met our expectation was patiala Lassi. This drags me to this place again n again. Hope such things will be taken in near future.,3,"7 Reviews , 8 Followers",12/23/2018 1:22,3,

Gal Punjab Di,Anupam Agarwal,"When you love food and especially north Indian food you crave for the perfect butter chicken that you would probably get up north.

I guess I finally seemed to have found it in Hyderabad.

Having been to the best Indian food joints like Grand Trunk, Norfest I guess the Butter Chicken here ranks at the top... Each one of them are good in their own regard though..

I landed up at this place basis my online food orders not through Zomato but through swiggy ( somehow that's an irony given that both deliver the same distance Zomato doesn't deliver from here to my place)

So probably I will not comment on Ambience and Service.. will update that later once I visit the place but food is something that's outstanding

In the last 20 days I would have ordered 3-4 times that's a lot for me given that I don't get fixated to a place as I m more of a food explorer üôÇ.

The food has not disappointed me so far. Items tried so far
Punjabi Butter Chicken - Must Recommend , the best you will find in town
Veg Angara - good
Bhatti kaMurg - must try
Tandoori Momo - can be avoided
Dahi ke kebab - brilliant for vegetarians
Murg Malai Kebab - good
Murg Tikka Masala - must recommend, the best part is that both the gravy's ( of this and butter chicken) are completely different which is hard to find. A person who loves chicken will understand my sentiments
Dal Makhani - must try
Tandoori Murgh - must try

So that pretty much sums up my journey with the restaurant for the past 3 weeks.. it's awesome do try if they deliver to ur place.

in Hyderabad then DO NOT VISIT THIS PLACE. The waiters will not listen if food is late, Manager is totally uncivilized (Tries to peek into customers wallet and also talks rudely).  

We ordered :

1) Daal Makhani (Not even average)

2) Paneer (SERVERD WITH HAIR IN IT)

3) Biriyani (Below average)

4) Tandoori roti

5) Sweet lassi

After finishing the food, they will serve you finger bowl with food particles already present in it..!!

Gal Punjab Di,Duggu,"Visited this place with couple of my friends today for lunch and their food is amazing.. Everything we ordered today was yum. The chicken was so soft and well marinated. Still drooling ü§§

We ordered the chicken jwalamukhi as a starter and were damn happy about the dish. In main course we had chicken palang tod which turnout to be another amazing dish. There gulab jamuns are yum as well.

Please do visit this place and taste their food.

I have been to this place for 3-4 times and everytime i just love this place. We have tried chicken lollypop, butter naan,punjabi chicken masala and spring roll.

Recently i have tried Tandoori chicken lollipop, yeah it sounds something different and u must try. The food was an absolute bliss along with the service of staff and ambience of the restaurant.

Lassi will satisfy your taste buds and cravings and leave you with a feeling of ecstasy.

I've ordered quite a number of times from this place, however not visited the restaurant yet. Also try out on their Kadhai Chicken which was superb. Highly recommended if you're missing the Punjabi tadka here in Hyderabad.

Gal Punjab Di,Johanne Rebello,Decor n all great. Reviews bought me here with high expectations. The food was rancid and didn't look well prepared or freshly made. I ordered some cheese kofta.

Gal Punjab Di,Rajesh Kumar Yadav,"Taste of food was very good. Specifically Palangtod chicken. One of best chicken curry that I ever eat. Since this was Panjabi restorant so don't expect Hyderabad Dum biryani but their biryani still very good I would say. On top of all Lassi was just awesome. Price is also very decent. So value for money.

Further improvement could be service time. But not a Big concern.",5,"8 Reviews , 21 Followers",8/4/2018 19:45,0,

We didn't like the rotis much. The naan was little thicker than it should be, and the lachha paratha was more oily. But overall we liked the food. The service is also good. The waiters were polite and asked for feedback after the dinner. We will definitely visit again to try other dishes.
Update:Went recently on Independence day. The paneery curry was just color and chilli powder. The paneer pieces were also very stiff. The rotis were also very rubbery.",3,"18 Reviews , 4 Followers",7/30/2018 15:22,0,

Ambience : undoubtedly quirky & eye catching
Food : we had ordered Sava futiya Seekh kabab, Lassuni Chicken tikka & Bhatti da Murgh for starters... Since I had my kids along, had to keep in mind the spice levels. The tikkas were juicy & succulent & extremely delicious.
Stuffing ourselves with the starters, we settled for Dal Makhani with Missi Roti & lachcha parathas, for we couldn't eat in more.

The MENU CARD in itself is very quirky, it actually sparks up a thought of actually tasting those times....
* Sheela ki shashlik
* sava futiya seekh KABAB
*gat gat galaouti

& many more

The only negative for me was the mosquitoes... If that's taken care of properly.... It's all a thumbs up",5,"8 Reviews , 3 Followers",7/28/2018 12:46,0,
