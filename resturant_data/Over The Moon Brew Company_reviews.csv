Over The Moon Brew Company,Mahathi Natva,"If trying brewed beer is what you love to do ... This place is a must visit . It's has a very rustic and welcoming ambience. One of their best beer would be the OTM Lager. For starters we had crispy lotus stem with water chestnuts and trust me when I say it's one of the best vegetarian starters I had in a while . The lotus stem is crispy and water chestnuts leave a refreshing feel on your palate. The sauce is sticky , sweet and sour and is surely a celebration of flavors. I would strongly recommend this dish as a must try. Also had the crispy shitake mushrooms they has a tangy flavor and a crispy texture. The chicken Tikka was one of the best tikkas I had. The meat was tender and perfectly Cooked.The mint chutney was a perfect match to go with.

We ordered 2 veg platters which were truck load filling. We couldn't eat anything more! Also ordered their apple cider beer and white high beer. Decent enough. Also wanted to try the moonlit one. But were sad to know that it wasn't available. Service was the best over all things said above! Mr Sarveshwar was quick to all our requests being made and had great suggestions to give! The sole reason why this review has a 4 rating instead of a 3 or 3.5. Only thing a lil lull about the experience was that they had stopped the music midway. So, that dropped our moods and spirits a lil! Wish the restaurant had it going till the end!

In the starters the 3 cheese layer mushroom, the Burmese wrap is also a must try in starters. Pizza was good the crust could have been little crunchy. Pasta was ok. Ambience is nice.

Over The Moon Brew Company,Devina Mohan,"Ambience of the place is amazing with good music. They have three types of seating arrangements, inside, lobby and open space. All options are good. Book the place in advance to avoid any hassle as the place remains crowded specially during weekends. Hospitality of the place is also very good. They serve the food nicely and even though the place was over crowded, they made sure to ask about the experience of the customers.

Apple cidar is one of the best brewed beer I have ever tasted. The alcohol content is appropriate and not at all bitter. Must to try at this place. Froscher is another good brewed beer.

Veg dimsums had great taste with stuffing of spinach, corn and cheese. It was served with three different kinds of dips. One of the dip was spicy, one had a taste of honey and last one was green chilli dipped in white vinegar. Chur chur with paneer bhurji with onion rings and palad is the perfect combination for all North Indian food lovers. Though the naan wasn‚Äôt chur chur, it was plain naan. Paneer bhurji was cooked well that brings out the taste of North India. The best starter was Burmese parcel with sweet chilli sauce. It was extremely good in taste.

If you are in Hyderabad, I will highly recommend to visit this place.",4,"151 Reviews , 418 Followers",4/28/2019 10:43,4,

Over The Moon Brew Company,Dr.vamsikiran,"The place and ambience was good.Only sour point was our waiter Kundan who told us to change places as soon as we were seated (maybe to accommodate his regular guests who tip him well).I had Zomato gold membership and showed him the same.Instead of taking a photo of the same,he started surfing the phone. When I objected,he denied checking the phone. Though the food and place was good,the waiter spoiled the mood just with his creepy attitude, which cost the two stars.",3,"16 Reviews , 28 Followers",4/26/2019 12:29,0,

Over The Moon Brew Company,Shubham Rajak,"Went here to catch up with a friend, very near the ORR entrance and right beside the main road. The interior was well done with the brewing machine at display which was the centre of attraction for most people visiting there. The seating was plush and comfortable. The choice of food was aplenty and the service was very prompt and homely. The preparation and plating everything was about perfect, but we did not liked the Lemon soda, it had some weird taste. In all it was good.",3,"5 Reviews , 3 Followers",4/25/2019 17:46,0,
Over The Moon Brew Company,Anupam Acharya,"Over the Moon is a brewery where you get a lot of beer to try from. We tried the apple cider(3/5), stout (4/5) and two others ( think one was called moonlit) (5/5) which were pretty good. The food was superb as well. We had the Burmese Parcel (5/5), Nachos (5/5), French Fries(2/5), Prawns (5/5), Chicken Kebabs(5/5), Chicken Poppers (5/5) and Mutton Kebabs(5/5). The place jas good music and later in the night people can dance. Overall an amazing experience in Hyderabad, which seemed to cover everything.",5,"207 Reviews , 400 Followers",4/25/2019 11:59,6,
